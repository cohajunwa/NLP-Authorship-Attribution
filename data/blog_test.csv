While I was singing a certain song, my microphone started to fade out.  I asked the sound guys to turn up the volume of my mike, but there was nothing they could do.  Something was wrong with the sound system, and they were unable to fix it until the show was over.  So I had to lip-sync the next song, 'Shine', by the Newsboys.         ",0

It's not as far off as you might think.  Answer at the bottom.   The first time after reconstruction that Virginia voted for a Republican was 1928 (Herbert Hoover).  It also the first time that a majority of the Confederate states did not vote Democratic.  60 years after the Civil War, they were still holding a grudge against the Republican party for ending slavery.  1964 - LBJ.

"        Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at   FranklinCovey :    Get SMART!   Ever find yourself lamenting, 'I missed it by that much!' when you don't reach a goal?  You think your plans are executed with precisions, and you avoid any covert obstacles that might be placed in your path, but you still come up short.  Your self-confidence wanes and you lose to the desire to make more goals.  Careful!  Chaos is right around the corner.  Be an agent of change and get SMART with your goals.  Here's the secret:   Specific:  Your goals should be clear and definite.  Measurable:  There should be a quantifiable standard against which to measure results.  Achievable:  Are your goals realistically doable with the time and resources available?  Relevant: Is what really matters most to you reflected in your goals?  Time-Dimensioned:  There should be clear and specific deadlines.  You'll be back in 'control' sooner than you know it.     ",0

"       Oh no. They changed the format again. WHY? ARGH!  Anywayz dudez, it's really quiet over here and I'm lonely. Boo-freakin'-hoo. I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere.  To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by  THE VIDEO .  Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho.   So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great.  We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it.  At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend.   We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's  The Anthem  and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t.  And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old clich 'play with fire and you get burned'.  I  didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story.  Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail.   AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out.   We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets.   Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew.  And by the way...not any of that caused the burn.  The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so 'smile all' to quote Rosie.   And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters.  We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing  Master of Puppets  and  Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer.   Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter.  Peace.    ",4

"            this is, hands down, one of the stupidest things i've ever heard.    SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.     http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html             ",1

"          So, where are all the jobs?    This is the question posed by    U.S. News & World Report   as well as by many job seekers.  In a somewhat technical discussion, the editorial examines why unemployment remains where it is, and indicates that there is a 'glimmer of hope for the jobless:' And here, at last, there is a glimmer of hope for the jobless. GDP growth may be accelerating and may move above 5 percent for the next two quarters. If it does, there will surely be a whole lot more jobs, especially in the labor-intensive service sector.   What's to be done? Not much, for now. No fiscal stimulus is possible, and the administration has already overdone its tax cuts. The only source of macroeconomic support will come from the Federal Reserve Board. It should keep short-term interest rates low and make sure rates for 10 years and longer don't spike any more.

We have only one child: our daughter Keisha Renee.  No one in our family has that name.  My maternal grandmother's name was Loraine, but we thought - especially after consulting my wife - that Keisha Loraine was not a good idea -  punny , but not the best choice (Ever heard of Quiche Lorraine?).  Actually, the name Keisha Renee just came to me one day.  It sounded beautiful.  Some time after she was born I looked both names up in a baby name book.  'Keisha' is derived from the same African-American word that means 'newly created.'  'Renee' is French for 'reborn.'  Hence, we've considered her name an inspiration from God: She was our 'newly-created' child, and our desire is for her, when she gets old enough to make the decision to follow God for the rest of her life, that she will be 'reborn.'  God has not yet allowed us to have any more children, but if we could have a son, we would name him Caleb William.  We like 'Caleb' because it means 'faithful,' after   the man in the Old Testament with the same name .  William was my father-in-law's name.           ",0

"           same feed from before, but this one was much easier to confirm; it's a far cry from her   point of view  just four years ago...      Nancy Reagan to Bush: 'We Don't Support Your Re-Election'    The widow of former President, and Republican icon, Ronald Reagan has told the GOP she wants nothing to do with their upcoming national convention or the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article   here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

"              Understanding Written Communication    I was inspired to write this as a result of a conversation Jennie and I had with our friend DB.  She received something in an email from another friend of ours, and what it contained seemed to disturb her.   Written communication can be difficult to understand.  Since I read words that have already been spoken, I only have that evidence to go on in order to understand the writer's message.  More exists than simply the written text.  As a reader, I must consider the following:    What is the main theme? What are the main points? What is the writer's tone? What can I get from the author's choice of words? What about the writer's style? What bias do I bring as I read? What is the mood of the piece? What mood do I bring as I read? If I know the writer, how is my relationship with him/her?    I propose that with what an author writes, he or she has put forth a challenge to potential readers:   Understand what I'm writing.    While some may consider that idea obvious, I believe it is important to examine more than simply the text an author has given us.  To truly understand an author's message, therefore, we must take an active role as we read.         ",0

"           When I was poor illegal immigrant of only 15, wearing nothing but a mullet, ruffled denim skirt, and fishnet top, Ben picked me up in a lime green 1975 Honda hatchback on the corner of Broad and Belvedere, and I became his bitch.  Fast forward 15 years, and I still owe him money.  Truthfully? Ben and I went to high school together, then worked together at King's MuthaFuckin Dominion ( always  use 'MuthaFuckin,' people).

"           Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             ",3

"           so true: After several gentle conversations, I have finally gotten my fianc to share his fantasy with me: He wants to have sex on the top of a bunk bed. He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",1

Criminal backround checks, for example, should notify the employer if the person is a murderer, a bank robber, or a rapist. In light of technological advances, an employer may look at a minor offense on the prospective employee's record as a reflection of the way that person is, no matter if they have changed or not.  I think employers should be trained to be more empathetic when making a decision on whether or not to hire. I also think that employers shouldn't have the right to inspect a person's history that isn't relevant to the future job. For example, if a rapist applies for a job taking care of people, the answer of course would be 'no'. If a bank robber applies for as a cashier, the answer again: 'no'. However, if a person who has a history of drunken driving applies for a job as a janitor then the fact that the drunken driving record has no relevance to the job applied for then the history sould be taken note on but shouldn't interfere with the chance of getting the job, unless of course the job involves driving, if the person hasn't been through some sort of rehabilitation.

"                 Linds, you brought up a good point that I had completely forgotten about.  You guys have been there for me with this whole divorce shit, but Becca MADE ME CRY.  Let me say that again.  Cry.  Me.  Z.  The implacable.  Or something.  ;) And then again, she didn't really do it, but I was in such a bad mood to begin with that arguing with her and trying to prove how much pain I was in made me cave.  But I'm doing better now.  Honest.  Well, I think.  I also was upset for Becca at the time.  Obviously I know what it's like to lose people, whether they're leaving or dying, but I had no idea that this was some DISTANT relation.  For all I know, she really did care, except for Linds's testimony, but I can't believe that she would dare to think that an uncle, distant or not, is more important than someone's HOME LIFE FALLING DOWN AROUND HER.    I'm sorry if that was extraordinarily bitchy or mean or selfish, but now I'm really pissed off.  More so than I was before.  Linds was also right in the original sides thing.  Rosie, you really didn't turn me to your side.  I found out information, some from you and some from Linds or Will or whoever else, and that was what made me change my mind.  So don't feel guilty about it, Little China.  *grin*  Anyway, just had to say that.  Um, two things.  1) What did you mean when you said that Phillip's like me?  Just curious.  And 2) Those seniors have no idea what they're talking about, except for the biased story they've heard from Becca.  I mean, are they your friends, aside from Gunter?  If so, I don't know what you should do, but if not, then tell them to fuck off.  I'm serious.  They have no business getting involved.  Period.  Abby, I thought you knew me.  Kind of.  I'm not sure of that, but I thought you did.  ;)  hehehe  Also...if you don't want to hear anymore about the divorce, let me know, but I'm kind of using this Blog to get it off my chest.  I don't really have another place.  Anyway, this weekend my dad and I had bonding time.  ALL SATURDAY.  It was all right, but not really awesome except that I did get to see X2 which was REALLY GOOD.  Anyway, on Saturday I went to his new house.  Not to stay but just to look around.  It's in Mooreland, that place on Moores Lane on the way to the mall.  It's really little and WHITE.  It feels like a sterile environment.  I'm making him have my room painted.  Anyway, that's about it, but it was pretty hard to do it.  Don't think he picked up on that, so I guess that I'm making it through all right.  So, back to Operation Becca, just one question.  What the hell are we actually going to do about it?  Please let me know just so I have an inkling.    I feel like I should be really guilty about something or other right now.   Nah.  ;)  ~Z        ",4

"           As I type, Mr Bush is having tea with the Queen a few miles away.

I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.

'Tis a good phrase, that T-shirt is hilarious, if I wouldn't get pinned for being a total faggot I would probably buy and wear. MxPx has another good one along those lines, but it's more male-oriented, some girl pulling some dude's heart out...like, literally. It sounds gross but it just looks hilarious.  Why won't guys talk? I don't know. Do all girls want to listen? It's really a matter of some guys are different than others, some guys have learned or have been taught differently over time. Some guys just can't stand to hear themselves say it, because it just sounds really self-defeating and repetetive...I would tag any communication problems with that one there. Generally, we hate doing it because it means facing things we don't want to see, and going places we really don't want to go, and even if it's about facing them with someone you love and trust, we fear the depression that comes inevitably, we don't want to bring that on these people that we care about.  It's a really difficult thing, and honestly it runs a lot deeper than I know, and I live in it. But still...it's something I can more feel and outwardly talk about than to actually explain the schematics of it. Maybe he will come around, and maybe he won't. And maybe you'll get so fed up one day, that you'll tell him to talk and he will. Or maybe, it'll be the end of the both of you. Yes, it's back to those horrible concepts: time and patience. Things really just don't unfold like a picnic blanket most of the time...Abby and I did a lot of talking before we started going out, so it might have seemed like some instantaneous process, but it was a project in the works for some time. With you and Rob, you already have the relationship deal going, so you're trying to be the best you can for each other, and unfortuantely, that means putting up a lot of walls because you fear judgment. It's great that you all are going out, I think it could be fabulous for the both of you, but really, someone needs to open up here. Had we known things were going to work out this way from the beginning I would have said yeah, give it a couple of weeks before we decide to get things going...but it hardly works out that way, and didn't. So it comes down to, A. giving it time, or B. doing it yourself. Either of these have their strengths and fallibilities that I'm pretty sure you've already diagnosed or have known for some time now, mostly because we've talked about these before.  But again, the choice is yours. It's like the Matrix, man, 'I can only show you the door; you have to step through it.' It's dumb and over-noble souding to quote movies and all, but that one is to a tea. It's your reins to grab, here; or, to let go...but it's all as you see fit.    ",4

"           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",3

"           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            ",2

"              Our Dog Jake   ... really needs to get neutered.  We have concluded that he does not care whether the other dog is male or female:  he is still 'interested' (nice euphemism, huh?).    Like this morning, after Keisha left for school.  I took Jake for a little walk without a leash in the little cul de sac area where we live.  I'm glad I spotted the male poodle with his owner first and grabbed Jake's collar to hold on to him.  The poodle's owner mentioned that the poodle prefers male dogs to female.  I was slightly relieved to discover that Jake is not alone in his preference for dogs of the same sex.  Last Saturday we took him to my Dad's farm in Indiana, and he met Icky, short for Ichabod, who is a dog old enough to be Jake's grandfather.  Let's just say that Icky made it very clear up front that he was not interested.  It was fun to watch the two of them interact.  As Jake would get close to Icky, Icky would growl and start to chase after Jake.  Jake, the much younger and faster dog, would get away unscathed, yet with his tail between his legs nevertheless.  Then, as I walked Jake around the farm, Icky followed.  As Jake would 'mark' his spots around the farm, Icky would follow up with 'marks' of his own.  While we humans were chatting, Jake and Icky would take turns marking the firewood pile, for example.  Silly dog.         ",0

           I appreciate your opinion re: the issue of liberating the Iraqi people from a ruthless dictator.  But that is irrelevant to my question.  Is it our fault that the Iraqi people looted their own artifacts?         ,2
"           Okay, guys.  I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and 'we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         ",3

"          Career Coaching    The right career or life coach can be a valuable asset to you in your overall career path. Often, people who seek career counseling are not only planning for their next job but the one after that (and the one after that)  looking at their careers in big picture terms and focusing their professional growth and development activities along that path.  Career coaches can help people to create and carry out plans related to their life and career goals. They can assist with resume preparation and job searches, guide people toward suitable industries or fields, or help resolve specific career challenges that are holding them back.  With the number of career coaches out there, it can be daunting to try to find the right one to work with. To help in this process, we've added a   coaches database  to Jobfiler.com.

"           something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'

I know we all wish she were here to celebrate with together. However take a minute to pause and just thank her for the contribution she made to your life personally.  I think that would be a great way to honor her today.  I think of all you daily and with much love, Margie  My grandma, Loraine Mitchell, died when I was in kindgergarten (1975).  The only thing I remember about it was when my Mom took me back to school.  She told my teacher that if I looked like I was feeling down, it was probably because of Grandma's funeral.  I don't remember a whole lot about my grandma.  I remember that Steph(my sister) and I would visit her and Gramps at their home at 52 Graham Street in Cincinnati.  She would make us 'brown cows' and 'pink cows' (drinks made with ice cream and either root beer or cream soda, respectively).  I also remember that she showed us how to make a flower using some facial tissue, a pipe cleaner, and a little spritz of cologne.  We would fold the tissue alternatively, like you would to make a fan.  Then we would wrap an end of the pipe cleaner around the middle of the folded tissue.  After that we would carefully peel the tissue up on both sides to create the petals of the flower.  Then we'd spray a small amount of cologne to give our flower a scent.  I vaguely remember she called me 'Little Bit.'  It turns out that she was petite herself, not much taller than 59 inches.  I see a lot of her facial features in my aunts and uncles, and sometimes in me.  She also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which contributed to her death.  I found some posts from Mom's blog about it from the April 2003, when Mom had an echo cardiogram done:    Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy Project   Mom's personal reflection on   being with her mother (my grandma) during her last days   I encourage you all to pray for my Mom.

"        U.S. Labor Department Announces Grants to Promote Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations  WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The U.S. Department of Labor today announced $1 million in grants to benefit women entering nontraditional occupations. The grants will go to 10 community-based organizations, which will help employers and labor unions recruit, train, hire and retain women in apprenticeship and nontraditional jobs.  'This Administration is committed to helping women learn about the opportunities available and the fields of work, where long-term careers can be realized,' said Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. 'From carpentry to masonry, more and more women are putting in long hours of training or retraining, and taking pride in the fact that their work is helping to make America greater.'  The Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grantees are: Oregon Tradeswomen, Inc., Portland, Oregon; Tradeswomen, Inc., Oakland, California; Women in Non-Traditional Employment Roles, Long Beach, California; Nontraditional Employment for Women, New York, New York; Women's Resource Center, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Montana Job Training Partnership, Helena, Montana; HRC, Inc., Wasilla, Alaska; Northern New England Tradeswomen, Inc., Essex Junction, Vermont; Chicago Women in Trades, Chicago, Illinois; and Area Resources for Community and Human Services, St. Louis, Missouri.  The Women's Bureau administers the grants with the Labor Department's Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services.

Don't get ulcers or ulcer-like things, kids, they're bad and they make you want to take opiates so that you can eat without getting killed.  I set things on fire tonight! Boards and stuff! We did hardcore racing trixxx with Seth's 30+ MPH RC car. Remember those remote control cars that used to be so cool? Well they've been advancing the technology on these suckers...they can top at about 70 MPH now. The only reason they can't go higher is because the frames aren't strong enough...the torque twists them to pieces over a certain point. But it's seriously the coolest thing in the world watching a little RC going as fast as a street car.  They have races for this kind of thing, so Seth and one of his friends started the 'L337 Racing Team', and I got drafted today, so I guess I'm in. And since my mom is going to be married to Glen sometime soon I'm going to milk him for all he's worth and get a real frickin' expensive top-of-the-line RC and just take it out on weekends and make some money with it.  Glen...  Rraugh.  Well, I won't be an EMO kid and trouble you all any longer. I was at Seth's and Abby called and I missed it, and now it's past 9:30 so I can't call back without getting busted...and I've caused enough trouble today....so I'm going to go cry in my room now and pretend that I don't hate myself.  cheers, mates    ",4

"        Effectiveness Tip of the Week    The Delicacies of Delegation   Parents, managers, and people in general have trouble letting go, and when they do, it's gofer mania!  'Hey, you!  Go for this and go for that.'  It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes.  Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done.  Here's some advice:   Desired Results.  Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it.  Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it.  Guidelines.  Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate.  Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do.  Resources.  Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them.  Accountability.  Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur.  Consequences.  Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!    ",0

"           john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  ' Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         ",1

He talks a lot about the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, which he recently signed into law: ... Next week, the United States Treasury will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks, putting over $12 billion back into the hands of American families. These rebates are the result of the Jobs and Growth Act I recently signed into law, which increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child. And because this new law reduced income tax rates, businesses earlier this month lowered tax withholding for worker paychecks. Now, those workers and their families have a lighter tax bill and more take-home pay...  ... My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs. Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services. And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it...  ... Government does not create prosperity. Government can, however, create the conditions that make prosperity possible. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 was based on the fundamental faith in the energy and creativity of the American people. With hard work and daily determination, entrepreneurs and workers are moving this economy forward. The American economy is headed in the right direction, and we can be confident of better days ahead.     ",0

             The Fourth Turning            ,2
"                 Here's something sure to liven your day.    AN ANGRY LETTER FROM ENGLAND Actual British complaint letter. The piece  suggests two things    1) Americans and Canadians are not the only ones who get poor service from  their ISP, cable and/or alarm companies. (NTL is a cable operator in  Britain).    2) The Brits probably write the world's best letters of complaint.    ====================================    Dear Cretins    I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your  four-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, telephone, and alarm  monitoring.    During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service  which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and  stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific  details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative and  seek to rectify these difficulties -- or more likely (I suspect) so that  you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the  working day smoking B&H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your  office.    My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my  spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your  technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes  listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying  Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website. HOW?    I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes --  an activity at which YOU are no doubt both familiar and highly adept. The  rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although  the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools -- such as a  drill-bit and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not  arrived. After 15 telephone calls over four weeks my modem arrived, six  weeks after I had requested it -- and begun to pay for it. I estimate your  internet server's downtime is roughly 35% -- the hours between about 6 pm  and midnight, Monday through Friday and most of the weekend. I am still  waiting for my telephone connection.    I have made nine calls on my mobile to your no-help line and have been  unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals who are,  it seems, also highly skilled bollock jugglers. I have been informed that  a telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will  be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is  available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone  (and then been redirected to an answering machine informing me that your  office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been  redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman. And several other  variations on this theme.    Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a  thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore and also another one of  those crucially important testicle moments to attend to. Frankly I don't  care. It's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in  print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me,  therefore, if I continue.    I thought British Telecom was crap; that they had attained the holy  piss-pot of god-awful customer relations; and that no one, anywhere, ever,  could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to  delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NT and because,  well, there isn't anyone else is there?    How surprised I therefore was when I discovered to my considerable  dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you  truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum, incompetents  of the highest order. BT -- wankers though they are -- shine like  brilliant beacons of success in the filthy mire of your seemingly  limitless inadequacy.    Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest  to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any  potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which  you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver. Any such  activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief and will  quickly be replaced by derision and even perhaps bemused rage.    I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cat's  litter tray, as an _expression of my utter and complete contempt for both  you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become  desiccated during transit -- they were satisfyingly moist at the time of  posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not  experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the  very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL and its worthless employees.    Have a nice day. May it be the last in your miserable short lives, you  irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twits.              May you rot in Hell, Robert Stokes        ",4

"       This is an account of my last night, as told by myself, who would be the greatest source of knowledge on such a subject:  The car ride home was a four year old talking to his mother. My chatter was incessant, the fever of 'hurdle-jumping', finally facing a long awaited day of judgment, still burning in my head. On and on about our performance, what we had done, what was truly brilliant, what I had done, every aspect of our victory, our miraculous performance; strangely nothing of the Instant Challenge past 'it was impossible but we made it', thus securing my vow of secrecy.  And the ride ran on for what seemed like not long enough, there was still far more to tell about, a thousand thousand wonders not yet embarked upon rolling about my tongue, and I langoured to spit them all out and watch them dance about and to let everyone share my joy at felling the giant. However, considering that I would be zoned for Centennial had I not been cheating the Board, as I will be until the end of this year when they change the state to open-zoning, the ride was  ultimately  abrupt. A few miles straight down the road and I was home, still talking about 'going to state' or 'yeah, well the 'TT' on my back means...'. I unlocked the door and burst inside, positively throwing myself at my two dogs anxiously awaiting their mother, and were not in the least disappointed at this surprising spasm of attention. After a minute of this, and calming mine and my mother's laughter, I stood up and went to the computer and typed several posts of our victory on the various BLogs to which I am subscribed that were appropriate as for such.   And then it all went down. The facade of energy and motivation for the day, the quick mind, the supple wit, the burning spirit, the mind intuned to one goal, all sank back into the dark places of my mentality and I was a common, fifteen-year-old boy again. Caffeine became a dull and worthless substance, I had just finished a Coke, and even after this and the one before I succumbed to sleep, I was  tired . I also gained a massive hunger, as the adrenaline faded into weariness and human need, as the 'Id' took over, and I devoured some leftovers in the fridge, possibly faster than I have ever eaten, even in down times after Taekwondo tournaments when I was younger, and once I had believed that those were the most nerve-wracking feats I had ever undertaken.  I talked to my mother for a while as the both of us watched TV, a absolutely lurid show about mortuary school on Discovery or TLC, and remembered a song that I had not quite forgotten that morning, one which stuck in my head as I woke, one that abbated the primal urges to howl in fear and aprrehension, as a caged dog in a place of foul scents. I remembered that I had been singing what I knew of that song to myself and it made me stronger, somehow, a great wall against the deluge of Noah and his ark.   ' I remember you...do you remember me too?...'Cuz I would give everything that I own, give you the skin and this flesh and these bones, the sun, the moon, the earth and sky, I never even stopped to wonder why... '  And I had a great desire to find that song and the words and learn it and play it and sing it to myself, because for just a few hours, the song had  inspired  me to do great things, and not even in physical manifest, but things inside myself that surprised even me. Things that made me sit and the awards ceremony last night and wonder, ' How? This isn't like me .'  It took two hours, because the lyrics are a bit trite, and the internet is full of scamming fools and false promises and broken things long forgotten. When I did find it I nearly shouted, in fact I believe I did. The song is, of course, called  Everything , and the artist, which I somehow knew as I typed the words into the last search box of the night, is Lit. I ran up the stairs and sang to the chordings (which were simple enough for me to pick out in a literal fifteen seconds) until my fretboard fingers began to redden with blood. I put the guitar down and set to reading. Then the world rocked me a hazy blow. I felt the dark circles under my eyes and the emptied will, and, nearly throwing the book down, I slept.   Awake . A small needle pushed its way into my arm. I sprang into wakeness in an instant at my attacker, and again the primal survival urge kicked it, the want to be not eaten in sleep. But still, my vision swam with shadows of juxtaposing dark with dark, and the world was a stream of Stygian night, a devil's soul blackness. And then a sandpaper upon my cheek, now my lips,  scratch, scratch  it said. I knew what it was, then, I knew, but I had to turn on the light anyway, to sate my curiosity.  Camille sat on my chest with all claws bared, especially happy to have finally received recognition for her prescence. She flitted happily around for a while, and I was annoyed to be forced to content my new visitor, but I was nevertheless, forced. Cats have a strange way of demanding your attention and getting it, no matter what they do. But sleep in us all is stronger than the hand of Prime Movers Unmoved, and darkness overcame once again. This scene repeated itself multitudinously during the starlight hours, but eventually I shrugged her off to the point that her cat lusts of 'mememe' died within her, and she curled upon the bed and slept.  I woke this morning to ragged thoughts of ' If only... '...   If only I hadn't stopped Rosie from giving me the ring and went on with the skit. Better that than the alternative...which we got...   They died in my head pretty quickly. I felt like a great iron box had fallen on me from a thousand foot tower. I sat inert for a while, and after an hour I had the gumption to sit up and read for a time. I turned the page, the pain in my head subsided, I turned the page, my blurred thoughts refocused, I turned the page, I remembered the triumph over misgiving from the day before, and I was moved to grin, albeit wolfishly, or so I thought to myself. And again and again, a turn, a new sensation, until I was assaulted with the full of my humanity and stood, taking a shaky step away from the bed to the window, awed at the sunstruck horizon, the sun that had not passed my eyes for two weeks.  Later on I would be typing an earlier part of this post and looking outside. There, I saw the ground turn from it's now-common gray shade to illuminated beige and green, crab grass and the sweet, common blades that decorated the scattered pate of the planet, and I rose as if by magic toward the door, I was drifting outside, hoping that the sun would last for just another second, I saw the clouds assaulting her again, threatening to shroud that wonderful lantern of day. I threw the door open and stepped outside.  It was a world of brightness and wonder. Wonder, I wondered at the blurred sun piercing a thin veil of clouds and I was blinded, but I was rejoicing in the coming of the sun, a touch of this galaxy's organic lifeforce once again, the monkey-urges satisfied for a time, and despite the sordid drops of rain, small and wide-spread, smiting my shoulders sporadically, muffled, a  pop , and upon my still-duct-taped shoes,  plick, plick , the invisible droplets heeding the call of their master, the veiled sky, to attack the hopes of humanity, the faintest and somehow most important need, to see the sun, to see that their hope had not yet died and that the sun had not yet quit a dying age of humanity. I saw it and felt it, and somehow a part of me long dead sprang into being, as, I think, it did to us all.  It was hope.    ",4

Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.

We're not into peddling pessimism, but a hearty does of reality comes in handy now and again.  The proverbial 'wrench in the system' can strike anywhere, anytime.  Unexpected change -- it's the law.   Expect it.   Change happens.  It's one of the few constants in society.  Commonly associated with negative circumstances and outcomes, unexpected change often gets a bad rap.  Yet, unexpected change can be exhilarating and extremely positive.  I feel a Paradigm Shift&trade; coming on!  Plan on it.   Rule of thumb:  'Plan weekly, adapt daily.'  When reviewing your daily activities, factor in time for unexpected changes -- things that throw your schedule off track.  You'll feel less frustrated and more in control.  Be prepared.  Go with it.   Kicking and screaming will only get you so far.  Change is good.

"         Dice.com - Job search for Technology Professionals  Today, I read through my automated job search agent for DICE.com, and found no less than 5 job postings by recruiters for the SAME JOB.  5 out of 21 jobs returned works out to roughly 25% of my time wasted reading the same job description.  The thing that I've learned about many of these recruiter posts is that if you do a little bit of research, often you can find the employer on the web and apply for the job directly.  Since recruiters charge a fairly hefty percentage for their services, it makes me wonder whether employers are using them at all these days, or if they give preference to candidates that come to them directly, without the extra price tag.  This is not to say that I haven't found jobs through recruiters in the past - just that in today's market, I'm wondering whether they are still of any use...     ",0

It's Saturday, yah, but even that is waning, making life horrible.  Yes, I live with all girls, and in context, PMS stands for PreMondaySyndrome. It's massive depression marked by the onset of a new week, mostly on Sundays but auspiciously clear in the slow points of really good weekends.  My dad almost got robbed today. He was asleep and the back door was open, then he heard movement and screamed, 'HEY!', and whoever it was ran out and slammed the door...nothing was taken. It's also all my fault since I took Katie to Guard this morning and, in our hurry, we left the door unlocked. I felt horrible, and still do, considering. Of course, da doesn't care.  He also just happened to come across a copy of the movie  Memento  on Friday, so we're going to watch that here in a second. Just happened to, mind, I didn't even tell him about Psychology, and suddenly he goes, 'I got this movie called 'Memento', it came out awhile back...' And then I told him the whole plot of the movie, the life story of the guy, his brain damage, his credit card numbers, and other cooler stuff, and dad was just sitting there going, 'Uh...that's cool.'  I drove about a hundred miles today, it was badass. I went to Opry Mills and bought a really cool toboggan, which happens to be really cool, albeit a plain, black colour. Guess whar I got it from.  And I heard CHINGY on the way home, and I cried when he said, 'POKEchop.' It, too, was sweet.   Y tu mama, tambien. OOH BIOTCH. Heheheh. That's the name of some Latin specialty movie I always see in the new releases at Blockbuster, even tho it's been out for the better part of two years. Just the fact that it says, 'And your mom too' is really frickin' cool. It would be even better if 'biotch' were attached on there, too.  And...the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza from Domino's is...eh.

"           the whole article:   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23373-2004Jun7.html   Memo Offered Justification for Use of Torture  Justice Dept. Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            ",1

'That will be $6.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out exact change for payment.  The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke,' and the ostrich says, 'I'll have the same.'

The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. 'Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?'  'Well,' says the man, 'several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, just put my hand in my pocket, and the right amount of money would always be there.'  'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. 'Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!'  'That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,' says the man.  The waitress asks, 'One other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?'

I think I was running on will power on the last couple of days since I came home and slept from 1am-11am and then 2pm-5pm...I think that's around 14 hours of sleep. I think I can honestly tell you all that I've never done that before. (Josh I now know the power of cherry coke=energy) Anyway I loved my roommates and I'm going to miss them, the randomness of our songs, the pregnancies and births, the veggie tales, the red-neckness, and the FON's/ DWH's. Ask me sometime what those means....each has a story that I don't have the coordination to type out but they are amusing to say the very least. I have a stalker and so did my roommate. I met some awesome guys and gals in my mission track team. I now have my own body guard that is HUGE...but he's in knoxville and he's also a youth leader. That came in handy when I told him that Fletch the stalker was being too friendly.  I think I'm going to try to get in touch with Cityteam...my favortie mission track. they're a drug rehab place for Chester. Chester was the good part of town to be in they it went down so now you can't walk outside after dusk or bad bad things happen. But i loved it. God's love was so alive there. Here in Brentwood it's common for people to take God's love taken for granted but the ones that were saved in Chester, they had suffered much but they also knew the greatness of God and they worshiped with a passion that I find lacking in Brentwood. I went to M-fuge to partly test my faith and see if I truly did believe...I found instead that passion for living in Christ that I've been lacking. Most don't know but I've been a christian ever since I was 7 but I drifted throughout intermediate and middle school. Those were horrible years so I've never told you before what happened then. If you guys really search, I don't think you'll ever find that I've really mentioned my middle school years beyond the fact that I hated them, I went to FMS, and I knew Arden and Christina. Becuase of those awful years I started at BBC and I have worlds of thanks to give them. I found a loving and supporting group where I did get to know Him more and now he's my Friend. I can't wait for school to start. I've failed so many times and yet he's still willing to see if my faith lasts and I pray that it will this time through out the school year and beyond. I love you all guys.       ",4

Finally my I asked my brother for a large grip wrench. He had none. Though he came up with the next best thing. A monkey wrench.

I hope things work out OK in any case.  Some guy just came to the door, raising money for a wheelchair basketball team. I asked me how I was doing, I gave the standard, 'Pretty good, you?' and then he paused, looked at me sort of ponderingishly, and said 'Really good...actually.'

Most of it is very unintelligible. He refers to himself as 'We' and says that 'they' have to do something, altho it's blurred in redneck so I can't figure it out. He left me a number, my dad tried it from his cellphone at work but couldn't get thru because the recepient's phone was out of the Cricket area...which illustrates another good point, he uses Cricket, which really doesn't surprise me, I get wrong numbers from the BIGGEST rednecks in the world...I dunno where they're hiding these people, but there's times I just have to say 'wrong number' and hang up because they're speaking American Japanese.

"              Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            ",2

Check this out, excerpted from a spot in the NY Post yesterday:   January 8, 2002 -- CNN yanks 'sexy' Paula spot    IN a wacky attempt to stave off the ratings onslaught of rival Fox News Channel, CNN went bonkers over the weekend by shamelessly promoting mother-of-three anchor Paula Zahn as 'sexy.'   Media-watchers were startled when a racy commercial for Zahn's show, 'American Morning with Paula Zahn,' ran on CNN over the weekend.   'Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart, oh, yeah, and just a little sexy?' a male announcer asked during the 20-second spot. The word 'sexy' flashed in red letters and an image of the well-coiffed blond anchor popped up on screen.   The ad was pulled yesterday morning.

"            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          ",1

"           Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.         ",3

"          Yahoo! News - Consumer Sentiment Highest Since Nov 2000    I think I understand it now.  Evidence shows that the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush have been good for the economy and job seekers.  As consumer sentiment gets better, the demand for goods and services grows.  The higher demand for goods and services means that companies work to provide for those demands.  This means investing money into hiring new workers, for one thing.  From the article (emphasis added): The confidence data helped ease worries that the labor market's slow recovery might undermine consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.   Consumers' hearty spending over the past few years, helped by  tax cuts  and low interest rates, has  helped keep the economy from suffering a sharper downturn .   Economists said a variety of factors likely boosted confidence: the holidays passing without any attacks, the rise in stock indexes to nearly two-year highs,  coming tax refunds  and an end to big layoffs.

"           God, I don't read the blog for a couple of days, and suddenly you guys are all prolific on my ass...  1)  I'm for Dean, because as a disabled person, his views on healthcare reform are compelling to me.  2)  I adored 'Lost in Translation' for the same reasons Johnathan did, and a few others.  One, it was very reminiscent of a relationship that I was once in.  Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.  And I thought it was a beautiful story about a remarkable connection between two people.  That human quality is something I enjoy in movies...  3)  I thank God that taste changes over time, or I'd still be listening to my 'Rainbow Brite' LP about 50 times a day.  I agree with Johnathan that the tastes in almost anything (food, music, activities, films, etc.) that I've 'outgrown,' so to speak, will always hold a nostalgic value for me, even if I don't engage in them with any frequency anymore.  4)  Comfort is my new favorite restaurant...FRIED OKRA!!!  5)  Today was my first day of classes, and while I'm excited about the resurgence of productivity in my daily schedule, it absolute whooped my fibro-ridden ass.

"            concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.'

CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.

"           All right now, Keeng, I never said that I hated MBFGW. I sneered at commercials because they make the screenwriting for both look unworthy of full production, and thus, wasteful. What's more insulting to the poorstarvingartist than wastefulness? (Answer: not much.) (And I apologise for not giving it a fair shake, but read on...)   I have to agree with your wry observation about successes making failures of art. I am certainly less inclined to see a movie that's gone mainstream, and yes, it is reverse snobbism. That's one of the unfortunate things that I got with my BFA: the belief that artisanally-produced projects appeal to connoisseurs, not the masses. I admit it's skewed (but tell me: How many pieces of furniture have been purchased in Richmond from Ethan Allen or Haynes or (godforbid) Target rather than at Harrison Higgins, who custom-makes beautiful solid goods right on Broad Street at Lombardy?). It's oversimplified & illogical to infer that I won't like a film because it's popularly acclaimed, yet I do it anyway, because experience has taught me that my taste isn't right in step with that of the general viewing public. Yes, I miss things. Yes, I regret the oversights when I discover & correct them. But I'm a stubborn, reactionary little human, and it's the method, although flawed, that's served me best so far.

"           I was with you until the last sentence.  It seems to me that ethical systems belong in the private sphere, not the public one.  In general, institutions make lousy ethicists.  Further, I feel the weak link of the sentence is the term 'best services.'  It is impossible for more than one human to agree on what that entails in all cases.  Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.

"              News from the Home Office   There is a lot to report on, so, without further ado, here we go!   Reading is Fun!  I've updated my reading list via   AllConsuming.net .  You can check out what I'm currently reading at   Dan's Domain .  There is one book I'm reading that is not in the AllConsuming.net database as of yet.  That book is entitled   Crime in the City , and it is edited by Martin Edwards.  It features short stories with the theme of big-city crime.  This collection was sponsored by the British Crime Writer's Association.   He Loves to Play Guitar!  One of my goals in learning the acoustic guitar is to be able to sing along with it.  Since I first started in December of last year, I have longed to be able to put something together that has some meaning.  Folk songs, children's songs, church songs, even the blues.  That's why I was so encouraged to find the tabulature (that's guitar-speak for the fret-string positions) for a great blues riff.  It's almost as good as having B.B. King here to teach me!   She Ain't Heavy, She's My Daughter!  Last Saturday morning, Keisha, Jake (our dog), and I went to the field near where we live for a walk and some outdoor play time.  I had the idea that Keisha and I could race between two markers.  I went first.  When it came time for Keisha to go, she resisted.  I offered to hold her hand and run with her.  We took off, but Keisha soon decided that it was too much for her.   She tried to let go, but I clung to her coatsleeve, and then she fell to the ground.  Eager to develop the fighter spirit in her (i.e., the resolve not to give up so easily), I bent down to pick her back up.  Immediately, I felt something 'pull' in my lower back, and I knew I'd made a big mistake.  I rounded up Keisha and Jake, and we headed home.  I applied some topical ointment (not Ben-Gay, but something similar) and sat on a heating pad.  Both of these seemed to help.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   It's not really a McJob  I had my first night of training at my new part-time job Saturday night.  I manned the bun warmer.  This task, of course lent itself to several double entendre type remarks: 'Here's your buns!  They're nice and toasty!'  'Hot, steamy buns!  Yours for the picking!'  During my break I caught a few minutes of Forrest Gump, which aired on ABC.  As a result, I broke into my Forrest Gump routine, talking in my best Gump-ish voice.  That seemed to entertain my coworkers.  There was that remark about whether my being around the grill had affected me, though...  Nevertheless, I helped the crew to close the place, and I made the 20-minute jaunt home.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Sleepin' In On A Sunday Mornin'   Jennie and I forgot to set our alarm clock, so we wound up waking up when it was too late to get to church.  I guess it happens from time to time to everyone.  I really wasn't in any condition to go anywhere, though.  My back was feeling the pain in a major way.  I wound up calling in sick to work, letting the shift manager know that I'd be going to the doctor on Monday.  Which reminds me...   Papa called the Doctor, and the Doctor Said...   Jennie needed Mom's car on Monday, so I planned to catch the bus to my doctor's appointment.  I headed downtown and bought a monthly bus pass.  Then I grabbed several bus schedules and headed toward the bus stop.  I had never been on that particular bus before, so I was naturally confused when the driver took us way past where the doctor's office was.  After conferring with the driver, I realized that I could have gotten off a half an hour earlier and walked the rest of the way to the doctor's office.  Since he was heading back in that direction, that's exactly what I did.  I arrived about 45 minutes early for my appointment, and there I stayed, caught between a rock and a hard place -- deciding whether to let the Musak put me to sleep or to continue reading the book I brought with me.  The latter won out, albeit not without a fight.  Soon the nurse grabbed me, and I weighed in at a hefty 217 pounds.  She led me to the examining room.  Not too long a young gentleman, a student doctor, appeared.  He mentioned that he'd be helping my doctor today.  I told the chap what was wrong, and he was able to manipulate the upper part of my back.  I felt a little bit of relief.  After he left, my doctor entered.  He twisted me up like a pretzel (well, not quite) and was able to get the rest of my back realigned.  I'm still taking the pain medicine (8-hour Tylenol) for a little while, but the prognosis is good:  No more picking up Keisha without proper back posture!  Yeah, I'm feeling better.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Doctor EverythingWillBeAlright   Okay, so I'm being a bit sarcastic or otherwise loopy in this post.  I went to see the psychiatrist today.  Apparently there was an incident between a patient and him this morning that involved the police, so all subsequent appointments were delayed.  I decided to wait in the unbearable heat caused by the faulty HVAC system.  I was afraid that the female workers were going to comment about my chest and bellybutton hair, though! (just kidding)  The wait was about 45 minutes, and I used the time to catch up with my planner.  It was almost like meeting an old friend; I hadn't really used it since last Friday.  I eventually saw the doctor, and we talked about stuff that patients and psychiatrists talk about.  He was interested in whether the scab-picking had subsided; I told him that it hadn't.  The scabs are just hidden by my long-sleeve shirt, jeans, and baseball cap.  I also mentioned some depression episodes I'd had over the last few months.  There were some really intense times, as I may have mentioned here, that I'd just wanted to die.  The doc calls them 'passive' rather than active feelings of suicide - i.e., not real, concrete plans to do away with myself.  We talked about how the past few years has been for me, how I felt I'd changed over that time.  It was really uplifting for me to see how much I have grown, how my perspective on life has changed.  I think I'm gonna be alright.  And speaking of things that are going to be alright...   Bookish voters approve library levy   That's the headline from today's   Dayton Daily News .

In general, we have two words to describe a body type:  thin/fat; tall/short/; etc.  We are a culture of extremes and linguistically-enforced simplicity.

Unfortunately, being creatures of language, how we speak and communicate greatly shapes our reality.

"             A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were excessively mischievous.   The boys were so good at getting into trouble that their parents knew if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.   The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.   The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.   So the mother sent her 8-year-old in first that morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.   The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, 'Where is God?'  The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide eyed.  So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, 'Where is God!!?'    Again the boy made no attempt to answer.    So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, ' WHERE IS GOD!? '    The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.  When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, 'What happened?'    The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, 'We are in  BIG  trouble this time, dude.

"           If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

"              Out She Comes! Part 5   When the doctor said, 'Let's have this baby!' I was puzzled.  I thought that's what we were already doing.  What he really meant was that Jennie was going to start pushing.  I don't remember if he increased the Pitocin dose or not -- come to think of it, he may have reduced it -- I can't remember for sure.  So, as a contraction started Jennie began to push.  And push she did.  I had never seen anyone go through labor before, but I'd heard that women show so much strength that it behooves a man to appreciate and respect her so much more.  Cindy was taping the labor, which we later determined to be about 21 minutes long.  I can hardly imagine going through 21 minutes of pushing, but Jennie did.  I recall Sue asking Cindy, toward the end of that 21 minutes, 'Is that hair I see?'  which I took to mean that Keisha was close.  After about 17 minutes, the doctor became concerned.  Every contraction was beginning to affect Keisha's heartbeat.  We weren't getting anywhere with the natural birthing, so he ordered a Caesarean section.  An anesthesiologist came in to administer a 'spinal' to Jennie, but she couldn't find the place in Jennie's back to inject the anesthesia.  So the doctor ordered a 'general' anesthetic, which would put Jennie to sleep.  Jennie was taken to an Operating Room, where they would perform the Caesarean.  Because she was under a general anesthetic, I wasn't allowed in the room.  I felt very saddened by it.  Cindy, who manned the camera, asked me to comment on camera what was going on.  I explained it to an older Keisha, who would later be watching this video.  Then I heard something that made me break into tears.  I heard our baby crying behind me.  Keisha was born at 10:42 PM, July 17, 1997!  The nurse came out to get a port-a-crib thingy, which they would use to transport Keisha to the Transitional Nursery.  She said that I could come in to see her.  So Cindy handed me the camera.  Just minutes from being outside the womb, there she was: all wrapped up in cloths, crying.  I was in awe.  God's creation, which we'd waited for nine months, was here!  I followed the nurse to the Transitional Nursery, where I met Ms. Yvetta, the Transitional Nurse.  She checked all of Keisha's vitals, and I was able to tape the whole event.  It would be important, I knew, for Jennie and an older Keisha to see all of this.  Yvetta gave Keisha her first bath, and Keisha cried when she got her hair washed.  She still doesn't like getting it washed.  Then it was time for me to clean her umbilical cord.  I was so nervous; I didn't want to hurt my baby or anything like that.  Yvetta reassured me that everything was okay.  Then I got to put her very first diaper on her.  It was a little thing!  But then again, so was my baby!  Sort of.  She weighed in at 7 pounds, 2-1/2 ounces, and 21 inches long.  After the Transitional Nursery, we took Keisha to go meet her Mommy, who was waking up in the Recovery Room.  It was a beautiful event.  I can remember holding our baby in my arms, just like it was yesterday.  Having a baby changes your life forever.         ",0

If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.

"             BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.    - Ted Rall           ",2

He said to the officer, 'May I go, Sir, and bring him in?'  But the officer refused.  'No one can live out there,' he said.  'I will only lose you as well.'  Disobeying the order, the man went to try to save his friend, for they had been like David and Jonathan throughout the entire war.  Somehow, he got his friend on his shoulder and carried him back to the trenches, but he himself lay mortally wounded, and his friend was dead.  The officer was angry.  'I told you not to go,' he said.  'Now I have lost both of you.'  With his dying breath, the man said, 'But of course it was worth it, Sir.'  'Worth it?' asked the officer in disbelief.  'How could it be?  Your friend is dead, and you are mortally wounded.'  The boy shrank from the reproach, but, looking up at his officer's face, he said, 'It  was  worth it, Sir, because when I got to him, he said, 'I knew you'd come.''    from a plaque I saw in Linda R.'s bathroom           ",0

Vin Diesel is a horrible actor, but that line was fantastic in that movie.  Life screws everybody; I'm sort of a nihilist, so I have a belief that the basis of life is simply having problems. The second part of that, however, the non-nihilist half, says that life is also about dealing with and overcoming problems.

And then the shit hit the fan. I gave my cousin Seth Lizzie's number, whereafter he called and left a message confessing his undying love to her. Then she called me and asked if it was I who had left that message, I said no, she said, 'OK, bye, sorry,' Then, Seth managed to get the number from me via stealing my cell and taking the number off of it; he then left several messages asking her to get married, and eventually breaking up with her. Once he called the wrong number and asked some random lady out, via voicemail. He left his number on that one, and after it was over, I told him, 'Dude, you just left your number,' He just stared at me for a moment, and then called Lizzie back.  Uhoh, she was getting pissed after these, say, eight messages. She called my grandmother's and Seth answered. He started asking her questions, and someone Seth got our of her that  Leigh Anne was getting her to call me and leave these messages . So with a look of mild shock on my face, I tried to take the phone, listening in on Seth trying to get her to talk to me:  'So do you wanna talk to Josh?' 'No,' 'Why?' 'Because he's an asshole!'  Oops, everyone hates me. I picked up the next time she called and, while Seth was busy pledging his love to/breaking up with Lizzie, I was asking her how she got my number; through Leigh, who was asking her to leave messages.

"           A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'

I get so encouraged when she shows us what she's learned.  She made a new friend, and she invited her and her mom to come to our church... Jennie was so inspired by that.  Me too!  Some people need to be told to evangelize, but this girl did it out of the bottom of her heart.  She was like this as we approached her birthday party, which was last Friday-Saturday (another post altogether).  Anyone we'd meet, whether at church, while shopping, at the doctor's office, at the library - she'd ask them if they would come to her birthday party.  We'd only invited five other girls, so when Keisha did this, we'd have to make sure these people knew that it had already been planned.  Still, we are so fired up about our daughter's natural exuberance!  It's as though whenever she walks into the room, she needs to make sure others know that she's arrived.  Now I understand that this behavior can be taken to the extreme and appear conceited.  Yet she has a magnetism that naturally draws people to her.  That's a great quality!         ",0

"           Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         ",2

I love her to death and would give up Phil for her but in her mind the choice has been made and that choice distances Becky from me, at least alittle, for awhile.

"             Last Tuesday the car broke down.  Maxine, the name Mom gave her 1983 Datsun Nissan Maxima and gave to us when she moved back to Texas last year, finally died.  I've written here in the past about the problems we'd been having with the car.  I'm reminded of a friend's comment that the least expensive car is the one you already own.  I'm also reminded of the scene near the climax of   'The Blues Brothers'  movie when their car falls apart outside the downtown tax assessor's office.  ( ASIDE:  Among the many   memorable quotes from the movie  is this one from Elwood Blues -- 'Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration, don't fail us now!')  Both Jennie and I knew that it was just a matter of time until the car broke down.  I had hoped and prayed that it would happen mercifully.  Last Tuesday, June 22nd, I drove Maxine to work.  I made a turn and must have hit a 'chuck-hole' (aka 'pot hole') in the road because when I got to the parking lot, I had some trouble steering the car into the parking spot.  After my shift I returned to the car to inspect whatever damage there was.  I saw that the front, driver's-side corner of the bumper had been bent to rub against the tire.  I got on the ground and bent the bumper away from the wheel.  Satisfied with that, I got in the car and started her up.  I put the car in gear and went forward (I had pulled into the parking spot in reverse earlier).  I went a few inches and felt the car fall forward.  I shut the engine off and went to inspect.  The front, driver's-side wheel had come off the axle!  That corner of the car was being supported by the wheel.  At once I felt grateful to God that it happened in a parking lot instead of on the street or worse, a highway.  I'm also glad that no one was hurt.  I returned to work, called Jennie, and walked home.  A half hour later, I walked back to the car, with two empty backpacks and a shoulder bag.  I got everything I wanted out of the car.  So it has sat for the past week at that same spot in the parking lot.  Since it's a high-traffic area (drive-thru, etc.), a number of people have asked about it.  Some have offered to tow it (that business card on the dashboard); others have offered to buy it or fix it.  Maxine is beyond repair.  I almost feel like I'd have to pay someone else to take her off our hands (lol)!  Yet if there is someone who wants to give us some money for her, then Amen!  Something else that's interesting... At the beginning of the month we had gotten 30-day temporary tags and some insurance for the car.  We knew that it didn't have a chance in h*** of passing the emissions inspection.  We had discovered that the only way to get out of an insurance policy is if the car would break down.  So, in general, we can see how God is blessing us.  Our lives are more complicated (Jennie works 3rd shift, for example) by not having a car, but we're managing, for the meantime.         ",0

"           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",1

"            from   Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

"           Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.         ",1

"                 Yes, there is indeed a reason for this topic.  I was on the computer checking my e-mail and blogs and my twelve year old brother came up here and told me to 'get off, I have to do homework' ths sounds like a reasonable request; until you realize he had been on the computer for at least three hours already this evening (we had gotten home approximately three and a half hours before this point, and the half hour not accounted for was dinner) and for at least two and a half hours I watched him play games on the computer.  So anyway, he comes up here and demands the computer again because he forgot to do something, at this point it's approximately 6:30, giving him at least two and a half hours before he has to go to bed, plenty of time to get back on the computer after I get off in less than five minutes.  So I tell him he can wait the five or so minutes it takes for me to check my blogs and respond when I think it's necessary.  He then goes berserk, crying, stomping, whining, screaming, temper tantrum, runs to mommy dearest, and demands she make me get off.  She then yells at me for 'being a computer hog' Anyone whom knows my mother will find this extremely funny because she spends at least ten hours a day on said machine.  And he proceeds to run up here and stick his tongue out at me and generaly look like he won. At this point I'm to this blog and I decided to start a topic about him.  so he tries to get me off for several more minutes, in which I type the message, go to all games free, play several games of collapse, etc.  I finally decide his frequent kicking, screaming, and biting has become annoying and decide to allow him to do what ever it is he's spitting about.  So he sits down witha smug look on his face to print off whatever it was, then he proceeded to go to Big Cheats or some sort site. This I decided would be an ideal moment to unplug the computer.  I didn't; but I did unplug the monitor and make it look like I unplugged the computer.  He then attempted to kill me in that abmisal fashion in which children think their punches actually hurt, but then I put my foot in his face (not kicked him, just put my foot on his nose) and he decided this wasn't a fight he was going to win, so he stormed off. At which point I plugged the monitor back in and shut the big cheat window and went back to what I was doing.    My question is why does he think he can get away with this?  What exactly is it that makes him believe that he can ever get away with this? and BITING? is this kindergarten?  Oh and I have a poll, I want to see just how special my brother is, How many people remember someone biting another person in kindergarten?  thanks      ",4

It may be your current one or a previous one - it doesn't matter.  I want to encourage other job seekers with your success.  You will receive no reimbursement from this, except for the gratification that your story has helped to inspire countless others who are where you once were.  Be specific, but don't mention any company names.  That may sound like a contradiction in terms, and you may disagree with this approach - let me know and I may reconsider.  Instead, use a generic title, such as 'software development consulting company', 'global consumer products company', and so on.  If you would like some help, then let me know.  I will only use your initials or first name and last initial when presenting your success story.  I am specifically interested in answers to the following:     What position were you applying for?  How did you contact the particular company?  Describe the interviewing process.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  Describe your emotional state during the process.  Were you anxious?  Excited?  Stressed?  Impatient?

But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings.

"           Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         ",2

"           Two off the wall and totall non related questions for the off the wall and mostly non related people on this Blog  1)  Is Bravo known as a gay network?  (ala Lifetime for women and Spike for men).  I was flipping around the other day and saw that Bravo is showing reruns of the West Wing.  I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.         ",1

"           Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals 'ought to have the same rights' (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

"           Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

"           john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  ' Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

"              Navy Summary of Mishaps - First Edition     Note:  I got this from ME, who is stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.    A.  Jackie Gleason used to say that he drank because drinking took warts and moles off other peoples faces.  What he failed to mention is the fact that booze, as a universal solvent, immediately liquefies all the cells and synapses in those areas of the brain having to do with judgment, coordination, and common sense; turns them to mush.  Afterward, its like trying to cogitate with a cranium full of Cream of Wheat.  Here are three quickies to illustrate my point:  --  A n airman with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.22 decided it would be the coolest thing ever if he jumped onto the back bumper of a departing Honda delete Sol to see how long he could hang on to the trunk lid as it sped away.  Got to give the kid credit for tenacity.  He stayed with it till 50 miles an hour, when his fingernails failed structurally, at which time, parasitic drag dumped him onto the highway.    --  A  pickup truckload of our Coast Guard brethren left a bar and headed down the road with four drunks in the cab and two more drunks passed out in the bed.  (Yes, as it turns out, our friends in the funny hats are human, too.)       After they dropped their first shipmate off at home, they regained the interstate and were headed for the second guys house at about 55 miles an hour when, like a scene from Night of the Living Dead, one of the corpses in the back stood up, wobbled slightly, stepped stiffly over the tailgate and disappeared into the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic.        Suddenly everybodys sober.  They screech to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Everyone bails out and races back along the interstate in a frantic search for their buddy.  But they cant find him.        Wait!  There he is!  Face down in the middle of the interstate  backlit by the headlights of a car that has him bore-sighted!        Time compression kicks in as they all wave their arms in slow motion and scream (in an extremely low register), 'NOOOOOOO!' Trying, to no avail, to ward off the inevitable.  Thump-Thump.  And the car sped off into the night  didnt even slow down.        But you know what?  The guy lived!  I mean he was messed up big time, but he lived, which means, in the face of this new evidence, that I must retract my previous statement.  Them Coasties aint human after all.     --  A s soon as a drunken Marine ditched his liberty buddies and headed back to the base, he spied a restaurant and thought hes stop in for a bite to eat.  The fact that the restaurant was closed didnt slow the sergeant down a whit.  This Marine wanted chow and no bars, no locked doors, and no alarm systems were going to stand in his way.        Perhaps it was the cold food or maybe it was the slow service, but something must have really irritated this guy because after hed been in there a while he began to tear the place up.        It wasnt long before the gendarmes, summoned by burglar alarm, arrived and tried some of their high-powered psychology to coax the Marine outside.  But, he (totally impervious to logic) wasnt having any of that and told the copy to take their best shot.        Well, in this case, the cops best shot happened to be a ninety-pound German Shepherd, and they told the hungry Marine that if he didnt come out, they were sending Bruno in.        'Bring him on!'  says the Marine.  And so Chief Wiggims let slip the dog of war.        BA DA BING!  The dog is on the Marine like white on rice and showing absolutely no respect for the sergeant.  Actually, Brunos finding the sergeant to be a rather zesty morsel (kinda like a slider at Mid-rats), and the fact that the Marine decided to fight back only served to whet the dogs already prodigious appetite all the more.         In the end, of course, the score was Drunken-Devil Dog - zero, Regular Dog - five.  (Five being the total number of useless fingers dangling at the end of the sergeants right arm that  ever since that night  have refused to respond to his commands.)         B .  I always get burn severity messed up.  Cant remember if its third degree or first degree that leaves you looking like a burger that fell off the grille and lay unnoticed on the coals for a spell.        I will say this, however.  I got this second degree burn stuff down pat, especially after I dumped boiling water and equally boiling coffee grounds on my hand one morning recently while trying to brew a cup of java while I was still asleep.        But that was small change compared to what a drunken seaman did not long ago.  It seems that six beers and a couple shots of bourbon convinced this guy he was an acrobat.  After ditching his buddies at the bar, our here made it back to the pier Ok.  But there, the lure of fame and the challenge of the high wire were more than he could resist.  So, instead of plodding drunkenly along on something stable and flat link the concrete roadway, this would=be Flying Wallenda jumped up on the CHT piping that ran parallel with the pier and began tippy-toeing along its length toward his ship.  And he was lookin gooooood, beloved.  Until, that it, he encountered a knot of pumps and valves that squirts a solution of highly caustic hypochlorite into the raw sewage.  There, he stumbled and fell.        But, true to his calling, he wasnt going down without a fight.  He frantically grabbed for a handhold  anything to break his fall, and he snagged one!  Unfortunately, what he snagged was one of those high pressure chemical lines which immediately popped out of its fitting and sprayed our hapless hero from head to toe with a caustic bath of searing hypo-chloride.        At the hospital they catalogued his misery as: second degree chemical burns of the groin, the abdomen, left thigh, right ear, left face and left arm.  And, for good measure, a third degree burn on his inner right thigh that nearly fried his oysters and will require several skin grafts.        But I did get a chuckle out of the unbridled optimism of this report, which said that, after five days in the hospital and 35 days out of work, No permanent disability is anticipated.'  Yeah, right.        I burned my hand two months ago and its still as pink as sunrise except when it turns purplish red in the shower and throbs like mad if I get it in warm water.  Dont let anybody fool you; this guys going to be in pain for a long, long time.         C .  I read in the paper this week that Daimler-Chrysler has embarked on a program designed to provide job security for the entire traffic safety section of the naval safety center for a good many years to come.  With the rollout of their new Dodge, V-10, pick-up truck, we enter a new era of potential disaster.  When one considers that sailors in the past have actually managed to break telephone poles in half using just a motorcycle, the possibilities for carnage, mayhem, death and destruction posed by this new, 150-mile-an-hour, 4000 pound, unguided rocket in the hands of your average North American blue jacket are enough to boggle the mind.        Heaven knows theyre doing a more than adequate job with the tools at hand today:         A  carload of sailors were on their way to a little weekend liberty, when the kid in the right seat spilled a drink in his lap and then turned and started ragging the driver about his erratic motoring skills.  The driver barked back.  So, in response, the passenger dumped what was left in his cup on the drivers leg you know, just to give him a feel for what its like to be facing a night on the town looking like youve recently lost control of your bladder.  This brought a heated retort from the driver, who totally failed to see the humor.  At which time the passenger doubled up his fist and smashed it into the windshield (Take that!), and the driver responded by slamming on the brakes and skidding headfirst into a mini-van in the opposing lane of traffic.         A t a party Saturday night I met a woman who teaches anger management to elementary school children.  I found that highly amusing until she explained to me there is real value in early training for the still undeveloped infantile mind in the techniques for handling stress and managing anger.  Maybe Ill give her these guys address to see if she can hook them up with some kind of correspondence course.  It couldnt hurt.  --- end of post ----         ",0
"           While quite a few pages still appear to be missing from the 1972 chapter of President Bushs National Guard duty in Texas and Alabama, at least a few of them may have been accounted for on Wednesday -- though not exactly in support of the administrations case that Bush fulfilled his service obligations. The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bushs Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bushs chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain theres not anything there that will embarrass the governor.   Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bushs file and documents from it discarded in a trash can. He said he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.            ",1

But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few 'A-List' blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is   GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,   GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results.

And yes, COLOUR! I got sick of the drabness and had to liven it up a bit.  Anyway, addressing the first line of this post...you'll never find it. I made it extremely difficult to near-impossible by not making it a public BLog. It's still out there, it just can't be searched for. And to find it, you would have to experiment with different website addresses. A worthless hint, I just wrote a new song and put it as the address of the website. And again, you'll never find it.

I'm just not doing it here because of it's sheer size...and I don't want comments on the work in the making, because that would screw up most of the story line and I would be PISSED. Especially since this is taking a billion years to work out. There's mini-essays to sort through, lots of lyrics, conversations to remember, letters to re-read...mostly, lots of stuff to remember, sequence, and write down. It isn't incredibly hard, it just takes time to figure out which piece goes where...most of the year I took as a single strand of conciousness, and now I have to take that thread and unweave it into its most essential elements.  It should be done by the end of summer or so...ok, not that long. It'll take a long while, but I'll get a lot done this weekend...after the part on Saturday of course, and it should be finished before you know it. A lot of it, all of you know already, since most of you star in it in some way or another. Basically, if you've read this site and TinHaven on a regular basis for the last two months or so, and I have open communication with you, you have a part in it somewhere. And then, there's stuff that's been in the BLog before and will be posted as part of the story again (i.e.: the 'goodbye' letter, etc.).

"   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  ",2
"       Ok, so imagine a shaggy drowned rat.  Now superimpose that image on a 16-year-old with long hair and you have...a bizarre genetics experiment. But no, today I remembered why I hate recording by myself so much...I'm the only one to get pissed off when things go wrong, and TRUST ME, I get plenty pissed off. So I was absolutely screaming in between takes today while recording...something...and sweating like no other because the fan was off and the vent was closed...so as to prevent that wonderful audial entropy called 'NOISE'. But that still didn't stop the cords from getting crossed and making a wonderful 128+ dB hum called 'FEEDBACK' that also qualifies as 'NOISE', expect I was using 'MIC LINES', and 'MIC LINE FEEDBACK' is so much worse than, say, 'AMPLIFIER FEEDBACK'.  Sorry for the biting sarcasm all. This is me pissed off and trying to catch my breath.   Not to mention the wonderful waste at MLK today...trying to get my ring back. I didn't, if anyone didn't get that earlier post. So I was incredibly pissed off today, but I did get to see Chloe and Boy at my dad's so that was frickin' AWESOME.  Man...every time I go to MLK I lose a bit of my rational thought for a while. Like, right now I'm trying to remember all those wonderful phrases I normally use, but I can't. Like 'OMG that is so L337'. There's one, but still.  End result: I hate my life. A lot. And my anorexia is saying 'don't eat anymore' but I'm going to, by golly, because I'm frickin' hungry.

"       Hello everyone.  It seems like its been a year since I posted on here, hasn't it? I thought I had lucked out when I got to Destin, there was an Internet caf down the street from our resort; however, it turns out it was closing the very week we got there, and by the end of the week, the place was ransacked and empty. I've been trying to retain all I wanted to say in this post all week, and I hope I get it all.  Stories...there are too many to start or end with: I saw a billion billion things there, and I could never tell them all. I can tell you I was stung by a sea wasp on the side and around most of my left ankle with a jellyfish tentacle, I was burnt on more than fifty percent of my body over the course of the seven days on that stinging sand under that eventually blazing sun. The blue flag flew the whole time, and the water was amazingly cold, but stepping within was a wonderful sensation nonetheless. I walked  everywhere , five hours straight the first day...and that was where I suffered the first burn.   On one morning the flag was red, and I, alone, stood at the shoreline and watched the waves roll in and collide; it was nothing short of majestic, they smashed together underneath that threatening gray sky, the waves rolled  from  the shore and hit the oncoming waves, and the resulting pillar was feet high. They crashed and rolled again and again, and there I stood for an hour watching them and listening, stricken with awe but giving no more indication than a wide-eyed stare, and later that evening, I did the same with the sun quickly dying, and as the tide reached its highest the ferocity kicked itself up a definite notch, the waters became monsters, the leviathans roared and pulsed their malevolence upon the shores, and, in all reality, took out a dune a few blocks of beach away from our own.   There are a thousand things I could say now, but truly, it was just a trip to the beach. I can put an upside-down spin on this whole situation but it was eight hours in a car, a few days at a beach, and eight days back. The end result though: it was something else, at that beach.  Surreality permeates my brain, and somehow it is blissful.    ",4

But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.

"           Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal.  As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech.  Hog wash.  If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  The Ten Commandments - Given that every judge puts his hand on a bible and swears to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America to the best of their ability without reservation or purpose of evasion,  so help me God  and that all witnesses swear on a bible to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,  so help me God , I don't see where the disconnect is.  Additionally, can anyone say that if we as a nation were to live by the Ten Commandments, that the we would be worse off?         ",1

"            No-Makeup Look Easier To Achieve Than Elle Claims   NEW YORKContrary to claims in the June issue of Elle magazine, the no-makeup look actually requires little effort, a licensed cosmetologist reported Monday.   'The article '20 Minutes To A More Natural You' suggests an application of under-eye concealer, light powder, natural lip gloss, and clear mascara to achieve the makeup-free look,' said Michelle Karns-Daley, spokeswoman for the American Association of Cosmetology. 'But really, a quick shower and a towel-off will do the trick just as well.'   Similarly, experts say Elle's six-page article 'Building Your Self-Esteem' can be more simply stated as 'Stop giving a shit about what other people think.'

'So, would you like to grab a coffee after your shift?' a nervous Leydner asked Ginny in both the real and imagined scenarios Monday. 'Oh, Brad, I can't wait four hours to see you. You should fuck me hard, right in this booth,' replied the Dream Ginny moments before Leydner achieved orgasm.   In the fantasy scenario, Ginny did not hide in the kitchen to avoid speaking to Leydner while he paid for his meal.          ",3

"           Answer from Ever-so-slightly-left-of-the-middle:  Though Dean's stance is to be as anti-Bush as possible, if you actually listen to him in his speeches and campaigning, he's really not that leftist.  He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.

"              Drink Water (or Eight Things to Do with Coca Cola)   This item was sent to me by MJ over a year ago.  I cannot verify whether the information here is valid or not.   Interesting facts: Water vs. Coca Cola   * 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world pop.) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.  * Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.  * One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.  * Lack of water: the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.  * Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.  * A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.  * Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop ladder cancer.  Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?   COKE: No wonder it tastes soooo good:   1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.  2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.  3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and ... Let the 'real thing' sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.  4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.  5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals. Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.  7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.  8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.   FYI: -   1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.  2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials.  3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years.  Still Want To Drink Up?   Update, 27 March 2003:   I've been doing some research on   Snopes.com , and I found this out -- The claim that the acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well are   false  .

"                 Man...having a license is so clich.  For us poor folk, the natural social obligation, and rung in the social ladder, is to go out, get a job, get money, and work our way into the world because that's what everyone else does, or did about a thousand years ago when they were sixteen. And if you really think about it, it's nice having a car, but at the same time it's a lot of junk too, like maintaining it, foremost, then, like, when mom wants some eggs or mayo, and she chrows (as in, 'throws') you inna the car and sends you packing to the store.   It's interesting how unsurprised the store people are when you come in really late and buy weird stuff, tho. That makes sense, I guess.  But that wasn't the point. Blah, I forgot what it was. Driving's lost its flair with me. My parents made me drive everywhere with my permit so as to put the fear of God into me, I can remember not driving TWICE with my mom, which is whose I drive 99 percent of the time.   But HEY, you might get the one-armed man. Abby and I have seen the one-armed man. I took my test with him, he was cool, albeit a bit silent. I think he hates two-armed people tho, and the fact that he has a very low paying job showing stupid people how they suck at driving, talking to him in languages he doesn't understand most of the time (and that's not bigotry, that's fact) probably contributes to his loathing of the human race.  I made up a really big story about the one-armed man and how he lost his arm and thus detests the race of man and plans revenge upon humanity, and it sounded really good, but: 1. I forgot it, and 2. He probably just wasn't paying attention and got it stuck in a grinder or something. Not so epic as being punished by the Mongols after he took his special time machine back to the dynasty wars to avenge his ancestors, or something to that effect.  It was cool.

This usually happens when I close the bar.  Tonight was no exception.  Actually, tonight wasn't that bad, in terms of its hectic-ness.  We did a bunch of liquor sales, but they mostly consisted of highball-type drinks (e.g., gin and tonic, bourbon and coke, etc.) that were easy to make.  I had to shoo people out of the bar at about ten 'til 2 so that I could finish cleaning and closing down.  After I left, I stopped at the convenience store and bought a quart of double chocolate milk.  Then I drove to the Taco Bell and gave the drive-thru attendant a hard time. 'Have I reached the border?' I asked.  'You've reached Taco Bell,' he replied.  I noticed the sign said, 'Think outside the bun.'  So I said, 'I'm thinking outside the bun tonight.'  Then I placed my order, letting the attendant know I was just kidding.  'Don't spit in my food, okay?' I said.  'It's too late,' he replied jokingly. After getting my food, I continued the drive home.  I've noticed that my most creative moments happen during this time, but unfortunately, I'm not able to record them.  A lot of the ideas revolve around fictional crime scenes, ideas for potential stories, and the like.  So I came home, sat down at the computer, and played solitaire, minesweeper, and freecell.

In fact, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal.  Yet I can't help feeling robbed.  Major League Baseball, since the strike of 1994, has not been that appealing.  Then we get a no-decision like we had last night.  Now there is talk of a strike this year.  Oh, great.  A glimmer of hope has been the arrival of minor league baseball in Dayton, Ohio.  Fifth Third Field, which seats over 8,000, is always packed, and the Dragons always provide an entertaining experience.    This feels like baseball the way it was when I grew up.  I remember the Big Red Machine of the 70's fondly.  My hero was George Foster.  When I played Little League, I had his number (3) and played his position (Left Field).  I nevertheless couldn't hit very well, and he was a slugger.  I guess we weren't meant to be alike in every way.  How will this season end up?  The Reds are in a pennant race for the NL Central division with the St. Louis Cardinals.  I'd love to see them win the division.  Whether we'll get a chance to see this depends on the outcome of the strike talks and how the teams fare.  I just hope someone wants to win.         ",0

"           I agree with John's comments re: TTT.  I also had issues.  But as a movie, I daresay Joe Moviegoer gets his motherf*ing money's worth in terms of images.  Fabulous visuals.  A shame the story is veering from Tolkien now not only in terms of tone, but now of plot.  Note that the former issue (different tone) was my only complaint re: FotR.  Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.         ",1

"           I listened to about 15 minutes of the State of the Union last night while driving home (which means I heard about 1 minute of speaking and 14 minutes of Republicans standing and clapping).  Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         ",2

"           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           ",2
