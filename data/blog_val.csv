"              The Winner?    Thanks to my old high school classmate LH for this email.   An old native American Grandfather said to his grandson, who came to him with anger toward a friend who had done him an injustice: 'Let me tell you a story. I too, at times, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they have done. But hate wears you down, and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times.'  He continued, 'It is as if there are two wolves inside me; one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. He saves all his energy for the right fights.  But the other wolf, ah! He is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is helpless anger, for his anger will change nothing.  Sometimes it is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of them try to dominate my spirit.'  The boy looked intently into his Grandfather's eyes and asked, 'Which one wins, Grandfather?'  The Grandfather smiled and quietly said, 'The one I feed.'  -- Native American Author Unknown         ",0

Roberto Carrillo  writes:  Last summer I received a name and phone number for a person who was interested in coming to church. This, of course, happens rather regularly. This particular person, however, was no regular individual; He was the lead evangelist of a traditional Church of Christ congregation in New Jersey, a congregation which was one of the fastest-growing congregations among the mainline Churches of Christ.  The congregation had been studying many different   DPI  publications over the previous year, and had been attempting to imitate our Bible talks, studies and discipling principles. He and the other evangelists and their wives began to visit midweek services.

"           a very sad tale from a scary city  A Roll Call: Decrepit Rooms to Wrong Pills   Broken Homes | The Operators: Voiceless, Defenseless and a Source of Cash (April 30, 2002  As operators and providers profit from adult homes, state inspection reports show that many of their residents go untreated and unbathed. Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid.

"           There definitely are, but it's a question of 'filling in the gaps.' Sometmes I don't have enough work for a 40 hour week, while some weeks I put in 60+ hours.

Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.

"           John - does your question about advance notice reference the Buddhist carvings?  If so, yes - there was a long build-up; I remember following it.  What interests me is if (a) the world community is responsible for the protection and preservation of specific nation's antiquities, and if so, then (b) how far does this responsibility go?  To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world is not in the clutches of conservatives, or liberals, or lobbyists, or lawyers; if it is trapped and pinned not by these, but by something completely different.  I'm beginning to wonder if our world -- if humanity -- has finally been overrun by idealists.         ",1

"           I just found a strange contraption called Beagle II on my roof.  Should I tell someone?  About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.    'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?

Becca told him what phil said when he called her a spoiled brat and 'can be repalced easily' and he's furious.

I don't want another shocker from her or for her to get out of shock when I get back or... basically I want her happy. you know infront of me she's going to put on a face that says everything is alright.

If we didn't date because of her she would feel extra guilty because right now she thinks that what phil really wants is me...We'll discuss that later...that's a whole different argument for another day. Anyway she actually told me that she would hate me if I hurt him...yea right. Take care fo yourself for me k? You know I would have bubble wrapped you before I left if didn't know you wold have killed me...after you popped it all. Just take care, hug yourself for me everyday and hug linds for me too. Tell will that I'm not a blind twit when it comes to phil and that no matter what I love him too. Linds... just bubble wrap her with a peguino in it...then let her out after she has popped.

Josh, you know how I feel about cheating and how much right now that Phil could hurt me. I also know that you know that becca wants to become closer to phil right now and not really with me.

Don't worry I'm not going to run home and go on a completely rampage, honestly deep down I would be extremely hurt and grateful that the thing has ended.

Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.

"           ...and that's what bugged me enough to post; that the film maker went out of his way to make the film 'historically accurate', but then dropped the ball on the color issue.  regardless of one's opinion on Jesus' ethnicity (or at least, that of people living in the Middle East during the time period he supposedly lived in), the actors could have at least been a  little  darker skinned - they all lived in a desert, for pete's sake!  you could have had a chinese guy playing christ in a snowstorm, as long as you didn't expect me to look at your film as a depiction of how the people and places 'really looked', which is what gibson's film purports to do (and succeeded in doing in many other ways, apparently).  but is that really the point when you're telling 'the greatest story ever told'?  shouldn't even a pretty good story be able stand on its own, in regards to its message(s)?  shakespeare's plays can be set in any time period, and they work fine; no one balks at the inevitable 'anachronisms', because his were universal stories from the get-go.  i wish more christians would do the same, by acknowledging the power of allegory to promote faith and belief, rather than insisting that the events in their stories have to have 'really happened' to be significant.    it doesn't matter if jesus ever really existed, anymore than odysseus or buddha or any number of characters in the great stories of our species; what matters is the message, not the messenger (or the creed).  what we learn about  ourselves  in reading about these folk is what matters.  in another thousand years, all of them will have been modified tenfold to suit the cultures and opinions of times to come, just as they have been many times before.  hopefully, the essence of the stories will persist and prevail - and not because we ever felt the need to prove that they 'really happened', which is all but impossible, and in my opinion, needless.

"              Updates to Past Posts Needed   Just so that you know, I am needing to post some updates to some past posts; namely, the   Swiffer WetJet  and the   McDonald's    ones .  So there.  This post will probably be changed to include that information.  Stay tuned, gentle readers!   First Up: McDonald's   I recently posted   an email response I'd received from McDonald's Corporate Customer Service .  About a week later I received a couple phone calls and then a letter from the local office manager responsible for the franchise in question.  Here is the text of her letter: March 20, 2003  Dear Mr. Johnson,  Thank you for letting us know about your recent experience at our McDonald's at 4770 N. Main St., Dayton, Ohio.  I am sorry that our attendant was rude to you and did not five you the prices you requested.  The employees should always answer your questions and be polite and helpful.  Our goal is 100-percent customer satisfaction and our team works hard to deliver fast, friendly, and accurate service to guarantee that each visit you make is a pleasant one.  It appears that we've let you down, and for that, I apologize.  I have discussed your experience with our restaurant team.  You can be assured that we're taking corrective action so a similar incident will not reoccur.  Again, thank you for taking the time to bring this matter to my attention.  The best way we can improve is if people who aren't satisfied tell us so, and tell us why.  You've given me the opportunity to make our restaurant better and hopefully exceed your expectations on your next visit.  Please give us another chance and 'Be Our Guest' with the enclose gift certificate.  We look forward to serving you better in the future.  Sincerely,  Paula Sullivan Office Manager This afternoon my wife Jennie and I returned to this McDonald's, and we experienced much better service.  I was treated to a double quarter pounder with cheese extra value meal, supersized, for free.  When Jennie asked if they had the double fish fillet sandwich meal, they were able to give her the price.  I believe that this McDonald's has redeemed itself, and I want you to know that.   Next Up:  Swiffer Wet Jet   In January   I posted  about an offer to call a phone number to receive a coupon for a free Swiffer wet jet mop.  This claim is false.  The coupon was for $5 off the purchase price for a Swiffer wet jet mop.  The offer expired February 2003.  Check out the   Swiffer page over at Snopes.com .

I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and 'we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         ",1
"              Bedtime Routines   Preschoolers need 10 to 12 hours of sleep.  Adequate sleep may increase learning ability, decrease accidents and improve behavior.  Many distractions frequently cause bedtime to become a nightly battle.  TV, video games, unfinished homework, etc., all interfere with bedtime.  Establishing a bedtime routine that is used nightly including weekends and holidays is helpful.  Some tips from the National Institute of Health include  Set a regular bedtime AND stick to it Establish a relaxing routine, such as reading a book or taking a warm bath Make after-dinner playtime relaxing Avoid eating a big meal close to bedtime, but do include a healthy snack before toothbrushing, especially if dinner is early A dark room is best but your child may do better with a soft nightlight The bedroom temperature should be at a comfortable level Making the decision to set an early bedtime for your young child and enforcing it has benefits.

"              I Want To Fire My Bank   For some time now, we have been neither been able to access our primary bank account online nor use our debit card.  This past Saturday morning, Jennie and I went to the branch of the bank, the one where we had opened the account five years ago.  We went to a teller and told her what the situation was.    After some initial research, she got her supervisor.  Her supervisor told us that our account had been blocked from access because of the repeated history of overdrafts to our account.  I responded, loud enough for other patrons to hear: 'So, we're bad people and we'll no longer be able to access our account?'  'Well, no, Mr. Johnson.  You just need to call our 1-800 number or come into the branch where you opened the account.'  'Excuse me, but that's where  I am ,' I replied.  'Well, we can clear that up for you, Mr. Johnson.  We just want to warn you that, if your account gets into an overdraft condition again, then your account will get the block on it.'  'Okay then,' I answered, 'so after this, we'll be able to access our account online and use our debit card?'  'Yes.'  Then we deposited my paycheck and left, believing that things would be okay.  Page forward to Sunday - yesterday.  On our way home from church, we stopped to fill up our gas tank, using our debit card, which doubles as a 'fake' credit card; i.e., so that we can use it to buy gasoline.  The gas station offered 'pay at the pump', so I kept the car running while I emerged from our car to check if our card would go through.  No such luck.  So we went to the nearest bank branch that we knew would be open on a Sunday, which was inside a local supermarket.  As we walked to the tellers station, we noticed that they had some Super Bowl cookies for customers to enjoy.  We explained our situation to the teller, who then proceeded to get some help from her colleague.  'Hmm.  It seems that your home branch has placed a block on the account on  any  debits.'  'We were just there yesterday!' I exclaimed in unbelief.  'Does this mean we can't even write a check to get money out of our account?' again, loud enough for other patrons to hear.  'I'm afraid it does, sir.  Your home branch placed the block, and they have to be the one to unblock the account.'  'I thought we took care of that  yesterday !  This is bull!!' I yelled, and proceeded to storm out of the store.  Fortunately, I remembered to wait for my wife and daughter.  After we had gotten into the car, Keisha proceeded to ask, 'Do we not have any money, Daddy?'  'I don't want to talk about it right now, Keisha,' I replied.  So then she asked Jennie.  'Keisha, I said not to talk about it, okay?'  After some gentle nudging from Jennie, Keisha got the hint.  To add insult to injury, we arrived back home to discover that our car could not make it up our driveway.  Frustrated and angrier, I drove to the end of the cul de sac, turned around and tried again.  Alas, to no avail.  Now, more frustrated and angry, I turned the car around and began to drive in the other direction.  'Why don't we get out and shovel the driveway?'  Jennie asked.  'FINE!'  I said, as I deserted the car, leaving it in neutral with the door open.  Jennie would take over the car, and I would shovel.  I got our shovel, and managed to shovel half the driveway before I ran out of steam.  Frustrated, angry, and tired, I  threw  the shovel across the yard in a fit of rage.  Then I sulked momentarily.  I decided to try again, and got more frustrated that the snow wasn't coming up as easily as I wanted it to.  I began to beat the snow on our driveway, yelling at it, and again threw it across the yard in another fit of rage.  Fortunately, I had cleared enough snow so that Jennie could drive the car up the driveway.  After she had pulled the car into the garage, I picked up the shovel, and put it back in the garage.  Then I went around to the backyard and wept.  I was so frustrated, angry, depressed, and altogether upset.  I sat down against our back wall for a little bit.  Then I noticed that our puppy had emerged from the garage and was on his chain.  He came over and licked me, which helped me feel a bit better.  Then, in a playful mood, I began to throw snow on him, which he appeared to enjoy.  So I piled as much snow on him as I could.  Then I got up, strolled over to the virgin snow in an untouched part of our backyard, and laid myself down.  It was rather peaceful and quiet.  I didn't feel quite so cold yet.  I thought about how I was feeling, prayed to God, and asked for his forgiveness for my fits of rage.  I'm learning that I don't know how to express my anger constructively.  I told Jennie in the car on the way back home that I felt like writing a scathing letter to the president of our bank, using the F-word, the S-word, and the D-word a lot in my letter.  I don't usually curse, but those words seemed appropriate at the time.  As did the thought of tearing the bank manager a new bodily orifice, if you know what I mean.  Jennie remarked that we should have just walked out of the bank office with all of their Super Bowl cookies.         ",0

"           Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.

I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.         ",2

"              Home from Work   I've been home from work for almost an hour now.  It's almost 5 AM EST here in Dayton, Ohio USA.  Frost is on the windshields and grass.  It's a balmy 25 degrees Fahrenheit.  We were not that busy tonight.  I found myself, during part of my shift, feeling down and wanting to go home.  I simultaneously feel that yesterday (Friday) was one of the worst and one of the best days I've had.  I'm reminded of my need to take my medicine and head to bed.  I've been picking at the scabs on my left foot and elsewhere.  My left foot, near my ankle, feels very raw.  Anyhow, I also am realizing that business at the hotel is very seasonal, and as we head toward the holidays, it also means we head toward a slow time.  I'm wondering if I should get another job, maybe one closer to home.  Also, it looks like we're going to have my Mom's car as our primary mode of transportation.  The amount of money needed to reinstate the loan we have on our car is something we cannot afford right now.  Working out the logistics for Jennie and I, when we both work on the same day, presents a bit of a challenge.  I was thinking about this as I drove home.  I need to get to bed.

"           JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.

"           As I type, Mr Bush is having tea with the Queen a few miles away.  It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.

"       I woke up with my hair in my face, and I was no one.  It was a strange set of events that had led me to this point. Sweating, I realized I was being suffocated and pulled hard my oppressor from my person. Of course, the pillow flew away with no difficulty and I sat assessing my place.  The first thing that happened was that I looked at the clock, which read 11:07. The first thing I had done was try to remember who I was, and with some difficulty, did so. Thereafter, I tried to assess the day of the week, as a dull ache called  school  troubled me to keep my wits about me even as I drifted into slumber again. Sleep never came, which is why I am here.   Next I walked to the phone. I remembered that Kenzie had said they would call me from the mall when they got there. Of course, I walked to the phone (albeit shakily) and picked it up, thumbing the caller ID button.    No calls since six?  What time had I fallen asleep? The call on the phone was one I had answered before I had gone to my room and fallen asleep. I was gripped with some animal panic instantly because I had remembered something important: it was a Friday, at 11 o'clock, and here I am at my mother's house, with my father downstairs, presumably. I opened the door and looked out. The hall was black; strange, as Katie almost never fails to leave a light on. But the air was black as pitch, and I went back to my bed to sort out what had just happened. More than anything else, I was plagued by the dreams.  They have come back, dreams of unnatural disorder that haunts me, even in its smallest capacity, and each time I wake and lose another piece of myself. I forget my current purpose, I forget my name, I forget the last person I talked to, or what has happened in the past year, I forget  all  of it. Slowly it floods back, but the silent emperor of the dream stays enthroned, a spike in my mind. The dream sat as I remembered the details of the moment, grinning its orai grin, harvesting my soul.  I went downstairs, pausing at the top, and despite almost utter deafness to acute sounds, I first heard the muffled pitch of my father's voice, or at least thought I did. For a second, I waited for some confirmation, and seconds later, my mother answered him. But where were they? I trumbled down the stairs and was greeted by a dark living room. Even the computer, which is normally always sparked with life, lay still. I heard their voices again and moved toward it. But what is  this , their voices coming from the same darkened room? As if it wasn't enough that my mind was doing a tapdance on my soul, something else unnatural, my divorced parents in the same room, sleeping...and god forbid... together ?  I pushed open the door slightly and tried my powers of speech, which was successful but slow nonetheless, with fatigue and forgetfulness. My dad slept on a feather matress on the floor in my mother's room, and they were tiredly conversing about us not getting enough sleep on the weekdays. I inquired as to why we were still here, my dad justified this by saying I was sleeping and he didn't want to wake me.   But all the lights were on in my room, dad , I had wanted to say, they were, and the primal urges told me this was out of place. Most of the time, as I sleep before I am supposed, I awake and the lights are off. In fact nearly always. It was interesting that they had left both of them on.   I walked to the kitchen and was gripped by hunger, I ate some peanuts and a glass of Wyler's awesome raspberry stuff that is no longer in production, and sat in front of the computer now to inform all of you that, yes, and truly:  I am going completely mad.

Someone who knows how you bleed and shares in it somehow everytime you do, not just sitting there and telling you to let it slide, that life's tough, whatever. It's a person that could say all the same right things anyone else could say, and yet, the way this person says them, they're just that much better. It's a person you would be happy to stand up and defend if all the world would fall on you if you did, the kind you would take a bullet for, an army's load of bullets if it came down to it, it's someone that would and has held my hand through everything that's happened for years now, that gave me a reason and a want to understand, that made me believe that I am something to someone, that still inspires me to remember the beautiful things in life, to remember that there is still love even when the world seems filled with black, that can pull me from the clutches of my very own ever-fucking prison if only for a while and remind me that they're still here, they're standing at the bars just outside, waiting when I'm ready to come out again. This person is life, this person is one I would lay down my very waking life for if only for five minutes with them.   I think the person whom (gram?) this is for will know it. I really thought of you a second ago, and you really just inspired me to type this down...I wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you, and I thank you for everything that you mean, and everything that you've done and will do.

Not Rosie, not me, not Leigh, not anybody.  It is hard as hell to break out of the little shell your used to living in.  Mine was the world of music; that may be yours, I don't know.  It's that thing that makes you feel better, but draws you away from the world.  That thing that sucks you in and doesn't let you breathe.  Whatever that thing is, you have to let it go, not totally, just don't obsess about it.  Everything in moderation, that's the key.  Josh, you're like the brother I never had and it hurts me so badly to see you going through all this.  Call me anytime you just need someone to listen.  Know your true self, Josh, and once you let that self out, things will just sort themselves out.    It takes trust too, in both yourself and in others who need to see the real you.  I lived (and still do to an extent) by the motto 'trust no one and you'll never get hurt.'  That's not all true.  Trust hurts, yeah, it really really does, but it also brings great joy if you let it.  Just be cautious of people.  Filter the ones that can hurt you.

"              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

"           The only discrepancy in the whole article that troubled me was Bush's insistence that he initially watched it on television, if the evidence shows he did not.  All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.         ",1

"                 If you don't like obsecenities DON'T read this. This week started off pretty good.  Block schedule, all my evil classes are split up and euro every day, my birthday is at the end of the week, i'm turning 16, we're going to pepo de buco (or whatever that new restaurant is), and X2 on saturday. sounds like fun. then I get into Robobitch's class and find out that the defense is not allowed to make a case because Mike has a clue and Mrs. Bitch's hand picked prosecution is worthless and incopetent.  ok im not going to let that get to me, then shinkarev for an hour and a half, fine its ok, still not mad.  Before I go further I need to describe the birthday situation for the last few years.  On my birthday we lose the soccer game sptaculary(don't fucking care about spelling), Im wished happy birthday only by aunts(except for the last 5 minutes before I go to bed then my parents finally remember), it always ends up that I get mocked by walt then one of my parents while the other one is yelling at me,and then Walt gets his presents before I do (his birthday is june 1 mine is may 3). and we have wretched ice cream cake.  ok having said that im going to go up the list, I'm going to go get my cake tomorrow(not one of the ice cream cakes that my parents are going to insist on) I got a twenty dollar stove a couple of months ago but the one thing I want is denied because walt is grounded and Once he gets ungrounded hewill refuse to play it with me because hes a whiny bitch.  one aunt has wished me happy birthday . . . i think. Ive already gotten mocked twice by my dad and walt and my birthday's not till tomorrow.  heres where it gets different instead of losing one fucking game this year I get to lose two and then get mocked by walt because he has a good team surrounding him and they win.  I need to start having birthday parties again, away from my family, maybe then people won't spend their time laughing at me.  by the way if I throw a birthday party, I don;t get to plan it or even get to chose who i invite( the list made out by my mom would include my best friend from elementary school who now spends his time making cracks about me, a boy I have'nt seen in years, and all of their friends, fun , fun, for everyone but me), and if by some miracle i do manage to get some people on the list that iv spoken to in the last year, they would have fun talking about the goings on at BA and then  a refreshing game of pin the tail on the donkey or some other nonsense like that.    sorry, lindsey for using your blog as a place to rant but im afraid if i didn't i might explode.  im also sorry to anyone who ive offended . . . o wait if ive offended you than either you don't like obsenities (which i do apologize for) or you are one of the ones at who manages to make my birthday the Hell on earth every time (in which i don't give a fucking rat's ass)  My dad just came over and told me to get a picture of me in a fucking indian costume rotated 90 degrees. yay fun!

"       Agh, I had a huge post last night explaining about Poor Bastard 2 last night, then my computer froze. GOD.  I posted the new track list to Poor Bastard 1, which includes Gin Blossoms (a lot of 'em), Rotting Christ, Taproot, Alice in Chains, Metallica, Papa Roach, Nirvana, Wax, myself...mostly Gin Blossoms.  Now the second one, like I was trying to say, is going to have a lot of the stuff I left out the first time.  A few more from  New Miserable Experience ,  Cheatin'  if it's not on this one, and  Cajun Song . Plus one from  Congratulations I'm Sorry ,  Competetion Smile , which I typed down, and NOW IT'S GONE.  And Alice and Metallica, say  We Die Young  or something off of  Sap  or something really hardcore, and  Dirt , of course, for Alice, and  My Friend of Misery  for Metallica, say.  Definitely more Jerry this time,  Give It A Name , and  Dickeye . There are two others that are really good, but I can't stand to listen to them anymore, they get me really depressed for some reason,  Breaks My Back  and  My Song . They're good, but I'm not going to put them on any of these.  I posted Toad once, so I'll put that song on it,  I Will Not Take These Things For Granted . What a change from the other songs, it's... peaceful .  And the Avril Lavigne song,  I'm With You , and Soundgarden's  Outshined .  I wanted to put  Glory of Sadness  by Roting Christ on the first one, but it's long, four minutes of music, like nine minutes of silence, and a weird outro for about two minutes. So I'm going to find a way to cut it down and then I'll put it on there. Plus  Khronos , it's not a lyrically pertinent song, it just makes me feel weird when I listen to it.  If you noticed, the full title of the first one is  Poor Bastard Volume One, August 2002-January 2003 , so that's about six months or so. I probably won't wait that long on the next one, it just depends on how quick I find about sixteen songs that mean something. I really also want to wait 'til Alex and I get  Little Rhyme  recorded, so we can put one of our own on every one of these things... My Solution 's on the first one, the last track because it's SOOOOOOOOO special.  One will be ready as soon as I get to my dad's today.  Well, I was gonna post a ton of those songs and then it bombed, and I really don't want to right now, I have the whole night ahead of me, and it's a free period in school right now.

At least when I'm being an asshole I figure it out eventually. This guy fucking  never  will. I'm not really concerned, it's just the fact that he called me as he did and knows absolutely nothing about me, firstly, nor have I done anything like he's doing. I know his kind well enough, plus his exploits equal asshole, so that's where I get it from.  Why the hell am I wasting my energy...  HEYY it's the 31st today, I thought it was yesterday...heh oops.  Well, I get to go home today and play Counterstrike, that should be fun. Then I get to cry a lil' more here, and burn a few CDs. And other stuff.  I don't have cable at my dad's anymore, him and his bitching about not having money left over after bills, what he has still gets him by, and  trust me , he doesn't NEED anything else, you can find ANYTHING in 'The Hole'. God, well, he'll get it back in about a week when he realizes how much he misses it.  'I Hate Myself And Want To Die' by Nirvana...what a great song title.  And with this, I bid you adieu.   Cajun Song  by Gin Blossoms  Well she's leaving today I do know So far away I'm feeling so blue and it shows In every single way Once that girl, she was mine For such a short time We used to spend every night Now all I do is cry  They say that you can't miss Something that you've never had So tell me why Why I could feel so bad  Well we used to walk down the path Just like lovers do She'd hold my hands and we'd laugh And I'd stare in her eyes, they were blue Once that girl, she was mine For such a short time We used to spend every night Now all I do is cry  They say that you can't miss Something that you've never had So tell me why Why I could feel so bad Why I could feel so bad Why I could feel so bad   Ok, a little corny, but it's a driving song.

Competetion Smile  by Gin Blossoms  Looking up I saw nothing but  Blue in the bluest sky And now it's creeping across my eye And falling down in my mind Down in my mind I'm high and I'm hopeless so Help me to get untied Fast asleep now I'm going blind And falling down in my mind Down in my mind just fine  Emulate the style A competetion smile  Now I'm running not looking and Opening up my brain Where it's easy to lose my name Looking dumb in the rain Dumb in the rain I'm hoping you'll notice that No one else helps me grow Oh it's not easy to let you know What I'm dying to show Dying to know you'll know  Pretending all the while A competetion smile  Now I've thrown something far And it haunts me like a curse I'm like a stone falling hard And I'm only getting worse  Looking up I saw nothing but Blue in the bluest sky And now it's creeping across my eye And falling down in my mind Down in my mind I'm high and I'm hopeless so Help me to get untied Fast asleep now I'm going blind And falling down in my mind Down in my mind just fine  Pretending all the while A competetion smile  I'm hiding high I'm hiding high   The story of my life in that song.   Hold Me Down  by Gin Blossoms  So I guess I must have just been dreaming When I thought I heard myself say no Anyway it looks like no one heard me  So here I go Cause when you're in the company of strangers  Or just the strangers you call friends You know before you start just how it's  Going to end  When the doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around Anytime the pickins look too easy Hold me down  I can't remember why I like this feeling  When it only seems to let me down Soon I find I'm searching for the exit  From the ground If I think the room is turning faster Then I think the music is too loud By then I've lived another broken story to let me down  When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around When half the party moves into the bathroom  Hold me down Or if you're at the tail end of the evening  And Dr. Feelgood comes around Anytime the pickins look too easy Hold me down  Down if I want that part Down if I've gone too far  Well I guess I must have just been reeling When I felt myself begin to fall I realize I'm bounding down the hallways  And off the walls If my bed was standing in the corner  I could just fall into it right now And know that I'd just be staring at the ceiling  Going round  When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   They're so drunk, I love 'em.   My Friend Of Misery  by Metallica  You just stood there screaming Feeling no one would listen to you They say the empty can rattles the most The sound of your own voice must soothe you Hearing only what you wanna hear And knowing only what you heard You, you're smothered in tragedy And you're off the save the world  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life than what you see My friend of misery  You still stood there screaming No one caring about these words you tell My friend, before your voice is gone One man's fun is another's hell These times are sent to try men's souls And something wrong with all you see You, you'll take it on all yourself Remember, misery loves company  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life that what you see My friend of misery, my friend of misery  Misery You insist that the weight of the world Should be on your shoulders Misery There's much more to life that what you see My friend of misery  You just stood there screaming, oh My friend of misery   'Tis beautiful.

"          President Bush's Weekly Radio Address for August 2, 2003    In President Bush's weekly radio address to the nation this past weekend, he spoke mainly of how the economy is behaving, and commented specifically about job-creation and unemployment, among other things.  I've included some exerpts from his address below, but   you may want to read the entire text  yourself: This week, we received some encouraging news on the economy. The nation's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter.  ...  Yet this week's employment report also shows that many Americans who want to work are still having trouble finding a job. My administration is acting to promote faster growth to encourage the creation of new jobs. The key to job growth is higher demand for goods and services. With higher demand, businesses are more likely to hire new employees.  The best way to promote growth and job creation is to leave more money in the pockets of households and small businesses, instead of taxing it away. So we lowered income tax rates, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, reduced the marriage penalty and increased the child tax credit. This week, the checks for up to $400 per child started arriving in the mailboxes of American families. That money will help American families move the economy forward.  We have also taken action to help small businesses, who are the job creators of America. We increased tax incentives for equipment purchases, giving small businesses an additional reason to invest. More orders for machinery and equipment means more jobs. And more business investment can lead to greater worker productivity, which helps raise worker wages.  We are starting to see results from our actions. My administration's economists believe that if we had not passed tax relief, our unemployment rate would have been nearly one percentage point higher, and as many as 1.5 million Americans would not have the jobs they have today.  ...  America's economy has challenges, and I will not be satisfied until every American looking for work can find a job. By steady, persistent action, we are preparing the way for vigorous growth and more jobs. I have confidence in our economic future, because I have confidence in the people whose effort and creativity make this economy run -- the workers and the entrepreneurs of America.     ",0

"            from   Penny Arcade :   I decided right away that I wanted to be a bounty hunter, and so with blaster in hand I began working my way up that particular skill tree. This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

"           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            ",3

"        Worst Jobs You've Ever Had   I suppose that it's not uncommon for anyone to take a job that, for whatever reason, becomes like a 'thorn in the flesh.'  Sometimes these jobs are necessary just to make ends meet; one might even call them 'survival jobs.'  These jobs are are the ones that, long after leaving them, we often reflect on them and say, 'That was one of the worst jobs I've ever had.'    Rasmus  recently started a new job, and he's mentioned that the work schedule is placing a heavy burden on his ability to stay up with his ability to succeed at school: I have a simple job: Wipe that desk, vacuum this floor, clean this bathroom. Anyone can do it and the pay is fair. But six hours five days a week is affecting my schoolwork. I'm not home 'til midnight, and though I'm extremely tired, I still need an hour or so to settle down. At school, I'm so tired, I can hardly finish a sentence, much less listen to what anyone else have to say, and doing projects is out of the question. It's not working. His experience reminded me of a job I had as a security guard while in college.  I initially took the job because I would have time to sit and do homework.  But I soon realized that it would be an extreme test of endurance and stamina.  After a full day of school on Friday, which began at 7 AM, I went to a part-time job at a hardware store from 5 PM to 9 PM.  Immediately after that, I went to my security post, and I worked from 11 PM to 11 AM on Saturday  By the time I returned home, I'd been awake for almost 29 hours straight.  All I could do was sleep until I had to wake up to go back to the 11 PM to 11 AM thing from Saturday night to Sunday morning.  I had a different post that I would go to from about 11:30 PM Sunday night through 8:30 AM Monday.  While I learned a lot about myself during this time, I'd still have to say that it was one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  >> What about   you  ?

"              A Weakness    'A simple man believes anything, but a prudent man gives thought to his steps.' --   Proverbs 14:15 (NIV)    This past Tuesday, in the parking lot of a hardware store, a man approached me, asking for help.  He said his car wouldn't start.  I told him I had jumper cables and that we could try to jump start his car.  Upon looking at them, he said they were the wrong kind for his battery and that he really should get a new battery.  He offered to give me $10 if I'd take him to the auto parts store just down the road so he could purchase one.  As we got in the car, I asked him if he went to church, and he replied with an enthusiastic 'YES!'  We started talking about some spiritual things, and he recommended that we pray together.  I obliged, of course.  I even gave him one of the business cards I'd made for my job search, which has my name, phone number, and address on it.  Just to keep in touch, you know.  I thought I was making a new friend.  He asked me to stop at a different auto parts store than what he originally said.  It was closer, so I did.  He went inside and returned about 30 seconds later.  He told me that he was three dollars short for the new battery and could I help him out.  He said he had the money at his home and could repay me after he got the new battery.  He also said that he needed $10 for the 'core charge' (core charge is what you pay when you don't have the original part with you when you buy a new one).  All I had was a $20 bill, so I handed it to him.  He went inside and returned about a minute later.  He said that they were going to bring the battery to his car, since it was just down the street.  He then asked me to take him home so he could get me $35 to repay me.  By this time I got a little suspicious because it seemed that he was taking me really out of my way.  He took me to the Santa Clara neighborhood of Dayton, which has a reputation for being a rough area.  He directed me to park in front of an apartment building and wait while he went inside to get me the money.  Fifteen minutes later, I realized that I was being scammed.  I left the area upset, angry, hurt, vengeful, yet prayerful.  I went home and shared the experience with mom and Jennie, and then I went for a walk to blow off some steam.  I was feeling seriously depressed about how stupid I was.  On the way to church, I was still feeling a little vengeful.  I fantasized about taking a crowbar to the guy's kneecaps.  Then I remembered the scripture that says that it's up to God to avenge.  At the men's meeting at church, I talked with a couple brothers in Christ about the situation.  I can be way too trusting.  The same kind of scam happened to me once before, about a year and a half ago.  I'm just grateful that I wasn't carjacked or hurt in some other way.  So I'm learning from the 'school of hard knocks' not to be too trusting of strangers.  My intentions were godly in trying to help that man, but I could have been more shrewd and gone about it a different way.  I saw the proverb that I listed at the beginning of this post, and I think it's a good one for me to store up and apply to my heart.  Thank you, Lord.         ",0

Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:   iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the   old  and   new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

"           r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.         ",3

"        Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from the folks at   FranklinCovey :    Self-Exploration: The Terrain of Heart and Soul   What do you really value in life?  Perhaps you have taken some time lately to reflect on what resonates within you -- those ideas and convictions that need no outside validation.  Because of demands on your time, you might not contemplate your values as often as you would like as you go about living.  Yet it's important to make a conscious connection with those values that govern your life -- the foundations upon which your life is both anchored and navigated; things like family, humor, and respect.  To help you explore your values further, try this exercise:  Locate a comfortable environment free from noise and distractions.  Reflect on the following questions and listen to your heart and conscience.  If I had to walk away from everything I ever loved, what would be left behind? What would I miss most if it were taken from me? What is of greatest importance or value in my life? As you go about your week, it will be vitally important to determine whether or not there is consistency between where you spend your time and what you value most.    ",0

"                 You know I'm to the point of unfeeling when I got this e-mail from Becky. It's all been said but I honestly just feel like not talking right now becuase I don't think I can truly be nice for awhile.  Hey.    First off, nothing I say in this email is meant as hostility and  what I say is an attempt at being respectful-I'm not sure if you'll agree,  though.     Next, I realize you've repeatedly told me a number of things. ex1:  don't complain. ex2: you've said in the past month or so to tell michael  the truth. ex3: a lot of people dislike me.     Now, I honestly haven't thought any of it for reasons I'll keep to  myself. (you don't need to know them and I don't wish to explain them.)  But it hasn't been until recently that I've actually weighed them with  the type of measure that they deserve. (Plus, no one has been out right  mean to me in a while, and I thought it was just another one of our  fights.)    All I'm saying is 'you won' so to speak. I'll rethink how I act and  try not to complain, I'll try to be a lot nicer, and I already broke up  with Michael. I know you don't respect me anymore and I haven't decided  if that is truly such a bad thing. (De Nihilo nihil... a latin saying  means from nothing comes nothing. ie, i can't screw something up that i  don't have.) All I know is that if other people are mad at me then  something must be wrong. I promise I'll try, and that's a promise I am  making to you all.     The only thing I'm asking of you is this: If I'm going to attempt to  change my ways, I'm going to need to know everything that I need to  change. I'm giving you a blank slate here... write down exactly what you  dislike about me or what you think I ought to change in order to be a  better person. If you don't tell me what to change, then I can't change  anything. I'm not asking you to stop being mad at me. I'm not asking you  to stop insulting me everytime you see me. I'm not asking you to stop  making the comments to Mike. (As is I don't like anyone. I'm sick of the  same outcome, and things will never change. Bf/Gf life doesn't matter.  period. And I'm sick of skirting around like a little 6th grader in  puppy love.)    So, basically, here's your chance. You can insult me. You can laugh  at me. You can tell people I like them, even if I don't, and I'm not  going to do a thing about it. You can spread rumors about me. You can  tell others lies about me. Fact is, I'm done being angry with everything.  It's not worth it anymore. God gave us friends to cherish them and I  didn't, so now's your chance to repay that wrong. I was wrong and all you  have to do is tell me more of how so. I hope things can change between  us, and I'll try to be the best person possible. Sorry for not  realizing it earlier. Bye.   I just love how she accuses me of spreading rumors about her.....I love her....oh wait I don't.   Smile all, Life's just peachy keen. *sarcasm*         ",4

For no heartache compares with the death of one small child. Who does so much to make our world seem wonderful and mild. Perhaps God tires of calling the aged to His fold.

Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

"           Despite President Bush's pledge that homosexuals 'ought to have the same rights' (1) as all other people, his Administration this week ruled that homosexuals can now be fired from the federal workforce because of their sexual orientation.  According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

I was drinking some milk at the time.  'So, how much is on it?' 'Oh...fifty bucks, I think?' 'Augh...ogg....ohh..eh....eh...' that was me choking my guts out, by the way...  So woot, fifty bucks for me, with which I bought CKY's  Infiltrate-Destroy-Rebuild , Linkin Park's  Hybrid Theory , Jerry Cantrell's  Degradation Trip, Volumes One and Two , and Metallica's  Master of Puppets , back when they were decent. So incredibly happy, I'll be sitting there smiling in front of my computer for days now, listening to such classics as  Sink Into The Underground ,  Owned ,  A Place For My Head , and the everlasting  Master of Puppets .

"       Eh~it's as good a topic as any, it must have been a very rewarding experience (in fact, I know it was). I won't be surprised if I hear in a few months that Mr. Holland's Opus became worn to the point of unuseable due to overuse a couple of months from now :) but that's the way these things go. The first thing I ordered for myself was a CD, long since broken...I don't even remember which one it was. But man, I felt like a million bucks, even if it was only $14.95 or something. Bitter irony.  Linds has it man (awesome job Linds). See, it's not that her post had any relevence...do any of them? Was there ever a specific topic line herein? NO. The point of the BLog is to post. It's like voting: you may not know shit about any of the candidates, but hell, you can say you voted by getting out there and pressing a couple of buttons! Well alright...that was sort of a bad analogy. But again, it's the principle of the thing. Just stir up a random topic, and voila.  I just watched  Interview With The Vampire . Man, what a great movie. There's you a random topic, in case anyone cares to talk about it.  Um...really, I can't think of anything. I could say a bunch about Interview but I don't think anyone would really care. Not too many people this day in age have actually seen it. I will say, though, it's a totally different movie now versus when I was 10 or whatnot. I understood the concepts in the movie the first time, but only on that purely rational level, this time I had that good understanding of why somethings were sad. Like, the first time, I was like, 'Die Kirsten Dunst! You bitch!' but this time I actually found out that this might not be such a good thing, even if she was a demanding little whore in that movie, and she made me want to punch somebody 90 percent of the time (she didn't this time, strangely). Ok, fuck this. It's boring.  I don't have much time right now, but I'm going to think of a great post and get back on here later. A topic, even. A topic that everyone will care about, even if it sparks lively controversy and makes us all hate each other. Actually, if that's the case, I probably am against it to, but again, it's the principle of the thing. Bah. I'm rushing this post too much. These things suck if you don't take your time with them. You can approach them without a point, sure, that's alright, and you can be bored and skip all over the place, it's still ok. But man, if you rush a post, it doesn't make shit for sense.  The end.

"       Oh well...it won't really matter in a few more hours.  I had an awesome weekend...sorry for the optimism all, but it was great. First I went to the Renaissance festival on Saturday, which was totally cool, and then I went to a drivers' training course thing called 'Driver's Edge', where they teach you to maneuver under extreme conditions :) Today was oversteering: basically, you spin your car out going as fast as you can, and then try to regain control. That was fun, we got to drive Camaros...god, those cars are bitchin'. Then, we went for antilock break testing and swerve control using a cone course and BMW 325is. I was the VERY FIRST PERSON TO GO. After the instructor showed us what to do (that is, gun it and hope the breaks work before you careen off into a ravine full of trees...no exaggeration at all, by the way, and grenading the breaks, then circling around and swerving to miss a wall of cones at top speed and mashing the breaks again...and then doing it a second time for good measure) I hopped out of the car screaming at the crowd to run away while they still could. Alex and a kid named Lonnie were in my car. They were just looking wide-eyed and the crowd was laughing at my yelling...I have no idea why the  hell  they would do that, I was  serious , I've never been so scared to pull a trick like that in my life. You think the Camaros are bad, and then...  So I got into the seat, and on the first run it's just to test if you can hit the breaks hard enough. I was good on the first one, though he made me wait a lot longer than anyone else to put them on. The swerving was fun. Then the second time, the narrow miss of the ravine. The only problem was,  I DIDN'T HIT THE BREAKS HARD ENOUGH . So he pulled the parking break and all was well. They said I was second place for the ABS Course trophy, and first for Best Screaming :) I got a T-shirt and a car maintenence kit. And it was all free too, care of manymanymany sponsorships, which were tattooed outside of a model monster truck sitting in the parking lot...this was all at the Opryland Hotel, by the way.  So there's my weekend, how about yours?    ",4

FUCK .  sometimes i just hate stuff. today was one of those days. you know the kind. the kind when you just wanna   SCREAM  until it hurts. the kind that you get when you're really fucking tired and you seem to find  EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE WORLD IN A SINGLE SITTING. THAT  was today. i think it was just the repercussions of that other post i made a long ass time ago. i think it's the little pissed the fuck off side  TRYING TO MAKE A STAND BECAUSE HE IS PISSED THE FUCK OFF.  just now i read a really gay post some other blog made. it was about high school languages and why people take them. and of course they slammed  ALL OF THEM  but they slammed french and called all of the people in it gay. most of the time i would sit back and then reply with,  'hell fucking yeh i'm gay, and i wear my purple with pride, you stupid heteros.'   but today was like  AAAAUGGGHHHH I HATE IT.  and so i sent an email that said:  FUCK THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING CROW TOKER I HOPE A BUS PRETENDS LIKE THEY DON'T SEE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET.  BAAAAH.  Actually, this post is quite sardonic in nature. It's was just meant to catharthasize,  because I love it . I dunno. I have male periods like no other. It's that being half-girl thing going on. I want to set stuff on fire...I say myself, but when it really came down to it, I would take the gas and pour it all over someone's house and watch it BBUURRRRNNN. And laugh my fucking tail off. I HATE IT.  RAUGH I HATE IT. Nothing works! God, I think it's my stomach. It hurts everywhere now. And I hate talking about it with anyone because of how fucking whiny it sounds. There are people with worse problems than me, or that have better stuff to do with their time. BUT I JUST HATE IT. It makes me PISSED. I yell at everything, and I think nothing is sacred, and I stay up late dead because it hurts the fuck out of me, and every time I feel it I get MORE pissed off, and it causes me to say, I HATE IT, and then it gets me to being pissed again. Hence, the cycle. We would simply have to remove the stimulus of pain, but that won't ever fucking go away, so, I LOSE!   BAH! I'm defective! There's nothing that can be found wrong, I was just put together wrongly or something. FUCKING I HATE IT. GODS! And so I feel like shit and so I start getting pissed the fuck off, and I HATE IT. I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS! I'M BEING REDUNDANT! FUCK!  Hahahaha. And again, it's all sardonic, kids. I really don't want to go to school tomorrow, so I think I'm going to get out of it somehow. God knows we don't do shit in any of those classes anymore. Or at least, I've been forced into a position of being blas because I have other things to THINK ABOUT. RRRAUGH I HATE I HATE I HATE IT.  Ok I'm done. If all of you would kindly just ignore this post, that would be cool. I couldn't go screaming with my dad today cuz mom's here busy whoring on the phone with Glenn. GOD!!!!! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. I just don't think I could convey how pissed off I got today when I told her she was going the wrong way on the road, trying really hard to get her to stop and then she speeds past three places she could have turned in and got to the place where we were going, then she pulls in the wrong fucking parking lot, thinks we're supposed to get out, I tell her it's the wrong place, she just stares at me blank-like, and THEN FUCKING THEN she YELLED AT ME BECAUSE SHE WAS FUCKING ON THE FUCKING PHONE WITH GLENN, AND FUCKING TELLS ME TO SHUT UP!  OH GOOD LORD, MY HEAD JUST MIGHT SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST. I can hear her right now, and it makes me PISSED OFF. Right, like you couldn't tell. God, I seriously need to get away from all of you before this all seeps through and causes lots of problems. God knows it already is. It makes me WEAK AND STUPID, and if not that, it MAKES ME SAY DUMB STUFF AND I HATE IT.  I'm going to bed. What the fuck am I doing?     ",4

"                Blogger  Template Woes: Strange AND Confusing     Last week , I changed the template for this blog.  As you may recall, I had to completely redo it.  This meant rerunning it through the   Blogmatrix Template Rewriter  again.  Once I did all of this, I noticed, after a few days, that the RSS feeds were not being generated/updated.  I've realized that I had added some formatting to the metadata tags that the Template Rewriter added, and this formatting may be what is causing the problems with the RSS feed.  So last night I removed the extra formatting and republished the blog.  I just returned to the template HTML that is stored on   Blogger , only to find that the previous template -- with the old layout -- is present!

"           Angie - I took absolutely no offense at your post.  It just made me realize what I did not know.  Ah, jazz.  I love big band.  I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

"              Dating My Wife   When Jennie and I were dating in 1994, I had just moved up to Dayton, and she still lived in the Cincinnati area.  We'd see each other maybe three times a week.  This was before we got engaged, which is a completely different story.  We started a tradition as our dates would end.  There was a White Castle restaurant close to where she lived, and we'd stop there before I dropped her off at her house (We didn't live together before we were married; I don't think that would have been what Jesus would have done, actually.).  We both liked their coffee and vanilla shakes, and we'd order one of each and then split them both by pouring half of one into the other, and vice versa.  Then we'd hang out for a bit until we'd finished our 'mochas.'  It was a really good 'bonding' time for both of us, and helped us deal with the reality that I'd be heading back to Dayton after I took her home.  As I took Jennie to work this morning, that memory just popped in my mind.  Yesterday she was off work, and we went to McDonald's to order some of the McGriddle sandwiches that I used to mock.  They're actually really good.  Maybe that experience is what helped me to remember our dates from 9 years ago.         ",0

"           Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?

Potter had left his most recent job on good terms and had stayed in touch with his boss when he moved cross-country.   'I would visit whenever I went back to the West Coast and have dinner with him when he came to New York,' said Potter.   Potter also built a strong network in and around New York City.   'A former colleague from a local agency called me and told me about the opening, and I sent my resume in. She talked me up to her bosses and they reviewed my resume. It turned out that they knew my previous employer,' said Potter.   'I had two strong references going for me -- a former colleague and a former boss. The agency interviewed tons of people, but I think these connections made all the difference,' said Potter. This is great news.    ",0

"           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense.

Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them'          ",3

"                 Thanks again all...I posted this in my BLog, but I thought I should come here and say it...thanks for the well-wishes, being sixteen is awesome.   ABBY, I'm going to post it tomorrow. And thanks for the hand, in a manner of speaking. I just recorded a new song and I was gripping the hand in frustration because I couldn't get those damn vocals right again and again. Don't worry, I didn't break it, if it even bent out of place a bit I frantically put it to a side and beat the holy hell out of my head with the hardest and closest object possible for even thinking of defying the holy relic. Once again, I am done. Maybe I should start talking to my psychiatrist about my limb fetish? Wait...what psychiatrist?  LINDSEY,  I want to see your hair dude, that's amazing. Thanks for the song!  ROSIE, thanks for the birthday wishes both on the phone and here, despite your one-track mind about me not telling you something. God, I don't know what you want me to say. I'm pregnant? There you go. I'm pregnant. 'Hello fetus, when you're ready, come out and meetus.' Heh, I heard that on TV today from some guy talking to his baby in his wife's stomach. It was really funny at the time. And you won't find it, so NAH. Jeez, jez hold on to yer britches for another week or so and I'll pull the fish out of the water, 'k?  WILL, thanks for the HBD on  Antiphilanthrophy , very surprised to see anyone on there. Hope your summer is going great.  That's it for now people.

What happened to the 'lazy' in summer vacation? Hey, I don't do anything, and from my perspective,  YOU  shouldn't be doing anything either.  One more thing...I was thinking...I can take my songs and put them in WMA format and send them through the 'net, so there's no more hassle of CDs...but that would take space and time to get into your inboxes, and in the case of Rosie and Will, with the dialups and such, practically impossible.

"          Staying Networked    Here's an article that offers some tips on how to keep your network alive.  This is good advice for any aspect of business or -- if I can reach a little bit -- life in general.  I touched on this a little yesterday, but I found the words of another to add to it: What a lot of people dont recognize, until they are faced with a job search, is that it pays to  stay networked  particularly in good times, when you dont feel the need as much to keep in touch. Staying networked on a regular basis will put you steps ahead of everyone else who has not remained connected when it comes time for a job search or getting the information or resources you need. In the meantime, too, you'll probably find some way to help someone else along the way.  It's hard for me to pinpoint exact instances in which this blog has helped someone get a job, but I know that you're out there reading it.

"            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.

"           Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a 'monumental failure'.  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?

"              Words Women Use    I appreciate this much needed advice from a woman for men on how to communicate with women.  I've heard it said that communication across both hemispheres for a woman is like a superhighway, whereas for us men it's more like a dirt path.  As a result, we need all the help we can get!    FINE:  This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use 'Fine' to describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.   FIVE MINUTES:  This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so it's an even trade.   NOTHING:  This means something and you should be on your toes. 'Nothing' is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. 'Nothing' usually signifies an argument that will last 'Five Minutes' and end with the word 'Fine'.   GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows):  This is a dare.  One that will result in a woman getting upset over 'Nothing' and will end with the word 'Fine'.   GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows):  This means 'I give up' or 'do what you want because I don't care'. You will get a raised eyebrow 'Go Ahead' in just a few minutes, followed by 'Nothing' and 'Fine' and she will talk to you in about 'Five Minutes' when she cools off.   LOUD SIGH:  This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement very misunderstood by men. A 'Loud Sigh' means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over 'Nothing'.   SOFT SIGH:  Again, not a word, but a verbal statement.  'Soft Sighs' are one of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.   THAT'S OKAY:  This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man. 'That's Okay' means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you have done. 'That's Okay' is often used with the word 'Fine' and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow 'Go Ahead'. At some point in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.   PLEASE DO:  This is not a statement, it is an offer.  A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a 'That's Okay'.   THANKS:  A woman is thanking you. Do not faint,  just say 'You're Welcome.'   THANKS A LOT:  This is much different from 'Thanks'.  A woman will say, 'Thanks A Lot' when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the 'Loud Sigh'. Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the 'Loud Sigh', as she will only tell you 'Nothing'.         ",0

"              Keep in Touch, No Matter What   See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. --   Hebrews 3:12-13   I am so grateful to live in an era in which the technology exists that I can communicate with so many people across so many boundaries.  I recently mentioned that   I found a way to use my home PC and an internet connection to talk to deaf people .  I just spent the last hour doing that, in fact.  A generous man will prosper;  he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed. --   Proverbs 11:25   And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. --   Hebrews 10:24   I find that, when I'm feeling down or lonely and I want to be cheered up, all I need to do is encourage someone else.  I know that by doing that I myself get encouraged.  I find great joy in seeing great qualities in others.  I learn to appreciate them so much more.  I spoke with A., for example.  She and her husband are expecting their third child in May.  He's been working so much lately that they haven't been coming to church.  She felt upset that I was yet another person calling to ask her why she hasn't been to church, and I can tell that it's been a sort of stumbling block in her relationships with others.  I just told her that I miss being encouraged by her and the chance to encourage her as well.  I mentioned to her that when one part of the body hurts, every part hurts with it (  1 Corinthians 12:26 ).  I said this not to be down on her, but just to convey my love for her and her family.  I want to call her husband, who is hearing, this evening.  Then I called to talk to T.  She and her husband recently had their second child, and I was fortunate to call when the baby was asleep.  She, like I, tends to wear her heart on her sleeve, which means that it's not hard to tell that she was encouraged by my phone call.  I asked her what I could pray for her about.  She mentioned that she didn't have a Bible, and that she wanted to get one so that she could read and learn from God.  We talked about some of the main points from last Sunday's message, and I shared with her a passage I read yesterday:  Not one of all the LORD's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled. --   Joshua 21:45   This passage clearly indicates that God keeps his promises.  I have a difficult time in trusting God, and it's manifested itself in a host of dysfunctional ways, as regular readers of this blog can attest.  As I shared this with her, I could tell she was encouraged by that, too.  I just want to keep in touch with my brothers and sisters in Christ, and others, too.  Over 12 years ago, I read this book called    Balcony People  , by Joyce Landorf Heatherley.  It's only a short volume, and I got the point after just reading the first couple of pages.  From that time on, I have desired to be a   Balcony Person  to as many others as I can.         ",0

Not that we've met him...he doesn't even come to the door to get my mom, he calls from behind tinted windows on a cell phone. My mom says the reason we haven't met him is so that 'You don't get too attached in case things don't work out.' I mean...ok. We'll get attached, sure, because I have, let's see...no girlfriend? Nope, I've got Abby...no friends? Naw, lots of good friends...no biological father around? Hmm, I've got that too...so THAT, friends, is exactly why I would become attached to him and the separation anxiety would simply be too much for me and lead me to death.  ...  It's all just so dumb.

Sullen, Depressed President Retreats Into Private, Paranoid World    A sullen President George W. Bush is withdrawing more and more from aides and senior staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome.  Cabinet officials, senior White House aides and leaders on Capitol Hill complain privately about the increasing lack of 'face time' with the President and campaign advisors are worried the depressed President may not be up to the rigors of a tough re-election campaign.  'Yes, there are concerns,' a top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday. 'The George W. Bush we see today is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful and withdrawn.'  Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House physician Col. Richard J. Tubb to put the President on powerful anti-depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay, but White House insiders say the strong, prescription medications seem to increase Bush's sullen behavior towards those around him.  'This is a President known for his ability to charm people one-on-one,' says a staff member to House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert. 'Not any more.'   read the rest of this frightening article   here .           ",2

"              A Santa Claus Story    from my friend Laura H. from high school :  I remember my first Christmas party with Grandma.  I was just a kid.  I remember tearing across town on my bike to visit her on the day my big sister dropped the bomb: 'There is no Santa Claus,' she jeered.  'Even dummies know that!'  My grandma was not the gushy kind, never had been.  I fled to her that day because I knew she would be straight with me.  I knew Grandma always told the truth, and I knew that the truth always went down a whole lot easier when swallowed with one of her world-famous cinnamon buns.  Grandma was home, and the buns were still warm.  Between bites I told her everything.  She was ready for me.  'No Santa Claus?' she snorted.  'Ridiculous!  Don't believe it.  That rumor has been going around for years, and it makes me mad, plain mad.  Now, put on your coat, and let's go.'  'Go?  Go where, Grandma?' I asked.  I hadn't even finished my second cinnamon bun.    'Where' turned out to be Kerby's General Store, the one store in town that had a little bit of just about everything.  As we walked through its doors, Grandma handed me ten dollars.  That was a bundle in those days.  'Take this money and buy something for someone who needs it.  I'll wait for you in the car.'  Then she turned and walked out of Kerby's.  I was only eight years old.  I'd often gone shopping with my mother, but never had I shopped for anything all by myself.  The store seemed big and crowded, full of people scrambling to finish their Christmas shopping.  For a few moments I just stood there, confused, clutching that ten-dollar bill, wondering what to buy, and who on earth to buy it for.  I thought of everybody I knew:  my family, my friends, my neighbors, the kids at school, the people who went to my church.  I was just about thought out, when I suddenly thought of Bobbie Decker.  He was a kid with bad breath and messy hair, and he sat right behind me in Mrs. Pollock's grade-two class.  Bobbie Decker didn't have a coat.  I knew that because he never went out for recess during the winter.  His mother always wrote a note, telling the teacher that he had a cough, but all we kids knew that Bobbie Decker didn't have a cough, and he didn't have a coat.  I fingered the ten-dollar bill with growing excitement.  I would buy Bobbie Decker a coat.  I settled on a red corduroy one that had a hood to it.  It looked real warm and he would like that.  'Is this a Christmas present for someone?' the lady behind the counter asked kindly, as I laid my ten dollars down.    'Yes,' I replied shyly.  'It's for Bobbie.'  The nice lady smiled at me.  I didn't get any change, but she put the coat in a bag and wished me a Merry Christmas.  That evening, Grandma helped me wrap the coat in Christmas paper and ribbons, and write, 'To Bobbie, From Santa Claus' on it.  Grandma said that Santa always insisted on secrecy.  Then she drove me over to Bobbie Decker's house, explaining as we went that I was now and forever officially one of Santa's helpers.  Grandma parked down the street from Bobbie's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk.  Then Grandma gave me a nudge.  'All right, Santa Claus,' she whispered, 'get going.'  I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and few back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma.  Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open.  Finally it did, and there stood Bobbie.  Forty years haven't dimmed the thrill of those moments spent shivering, beside my grandma, in Bobbie Decker's bushes.  That night, I realized that those awful rumors about Santa Claus were just what Grandma said they were: ridiculous.  Santa was alive and well, and we were on his team.         ",0

"              Letter from Boot Camp - A Letter From a Farmer, now at Camp Pendleton  --  from Steve K.'s forwarded email:    Dear Ma & Pa; Am well. Hope you are. Tell brother Walt & Brother Elmer the Marine Corps beats working for old man Minch by a mile. Tell them to join up quick before maybe all of the places are filled.   I was restless at first because you got to stay in bed till nearly 6 a.m., but am getting so I like to sleep late. Tell Walt & Elmer all you do before breakfast is smooth your cot and shine some things. No hogs to slop, feed to pitch, mash to mix, wood to split, fire to lay. Practically nothing. Men got to shave but it is not so bad, they git warm water.   Breakfast is strong on trimmings like fruit juice, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc..., but kind of weak on chops, potatoes, ham, steak, fried eggplant, pie and other regular food. But tell Walt & Elmer you can always sit between two city boys that live on coffee. Their food plus yours holds you till noon, when you get fed again. It's no wonder these city boys can't walk much.   We go on 'route' marches, which the Platoon Seargent says are long walks to harden us. If he thinks so, it is not my place to tell him different. A 'route march' is about as far as to our mailbox at home. Then the city guys get sore feet, and we all ride back in trucks. The country is nice, but awful flat. The Seargent is like a schoolteacher. He nags some. The Capt. is like the school board. Majors & Colonels just ride around & frown. They don't bother you none. This next will kill Walt & Elmer with laughing.   I keep getting medals for shooting. I don't know why. The bulls-eye is near as big as a chipmunk and don't move. And it ain't shooting at you, like the Higgett boys at home. All you got to do is lie there all comfortable and hit it. You don't even load your own cartridges. They come in boxes. Be sure to tell Walt & Elmer to hurry & join before other fellers get into this setup & come stampeding in.   Your loving daughter, Gail   P.S. Speaking of shooting, enclosed is $200 towards a new barn roof & ma's teeth. The city boys shoot craps, but not very good.         ",0

"       You're reading way too deep into this.  I didn't say that I never wanted you as friends, I just didn't want to be criticized for the things I've been doing, and I was getting that.  Especially from Rosie, unfortunately. I hope you remember your reaction at Lindsey's house on Friday. Because I sure as  hell  do.  I've decided not to remove anyone, that was Leigh Anne's wish that there be no one but myself on here, and it would be foolish to adhere to it, considering she'll never find it.  I really don't know what to find out of anyone anymore...I really want to see what's left after all that's happened so far. Perhaps last night's post was to test my real friends from the ones who really do use me and this plight as entertainment, and seeing as how I wasn't attacked directly, and in fact the matter at hand wasn't attacked, I really have found the ones that will stay.  Not that that was my preliminary intention; I know this probably did cause a lot of damage, but I cannot apologize, I had to know.  To understand me, you have to know that my world is made up of definites, and anything that goes against that will not work. My fear of commitment and God, all because they are not definite.   And the real me is a screaming little boy. He's locked away and huddled over and screaming his lungs out, he's cold and alone and he loves it that way, even though he hates it, because I could let that boy out but I am afraid to, because I don't know if he'll be the one to change from it.  Plus the fact that the things he wants to show all of you and tell you that he's seen. No one would like what he sees, he envisions the world as innately evil, and truly, he is right, but he knows the depth of it.  It scares me because the boy is cunning. He's something else...I could call him wicked but that's not what he is, he's been twisted by his thoughts.  He only comes out at my worst, he came out on the last post and did something that probably destabalized the people it was aimed at. But it's something he wants you to hear so that it will stop bothering him, it's bothering him that he could ever think that he was being blamed for something that isn't his fault.  Don't expect an apology, that post wasn't pure malice. That was the reality in my head.  To understand me, find me at my worst and learn.  But never judge.      ",4

"           Q:  I've noticed an interesting trend over the last few years: You can sometimes tell who the 'bad guys' are in a movie or TV show by what computer they use. For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'          ",3

"           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         ",3

"                 Hi kids!  I just posted on every frickin' BLog in the universe so I thought I would stop in and give y'all a shout on said universal tour.  NO WAY Z, THAT IS SO L337! Enjoy rockin' the burbs in your tryk'd-out rizzizle.  Heya Scott, welcome back. You're right, it has been a frickin'ly long while.  I dun care if he sees it, not like there's anything too hazardous on said wonderful BLog.  Oh Abby...you've reached the dark enlightenment. Rraugh! Everytime I think about school....well, I was going to say I want to cry or be an EMO kid and kill myself, but I've come to the point where I feel like I can still do good without pressuring myself over it. So school isn't so threatening as it has been the last eleven years. But you are right, none of that stuff matters. If you really think about it, what's the immediate practicality in algebra? If you're going to apply yourself to that kind of career, sure. But it's not like you're going to use it to fill out your W2s or to go on a scavenger hunt at the company picnic with the wife and kids and have to find the mystery variable to locate 'a pink frisbee' or anything like that. 'Let sleeping dogs lie' as to history...it's Greco-inspired BS, I just can't see how it would be quintessential to human existence to have to know about a bunch of fumbling idiots screwing the future. And  Low Rider ...well, let's just say if you'd learned it on the banjo it would be a lot more worth it, heheh. But teachers are incredibly gay and hellbent on self-preservation...'let's keep that work coming so we can make enough to get a Happy Meal at McDonald's some day'.  WOW ARE TEACHERS COOL. Like Mr. Bastard.  Mr. Adams's isn't giving a curve this year...I feel really bad for Sarah Heines and Jonathan (kid who rides my bus and a huge Stranglebox fan (w00t!), taking Euro this year). But he says he needs to weed the boys from the men. And suddenly I remember that I have to take AP tests again and my life became horrible. After all that BS about 'haha skool is gay & i dun care no more'. BLAH.  And as to the last posts (if anyone hasn't notice, I responded to them backwards from my last one) from Linds and Rosie...please just remember that you can only do so much before it's too much. When you feel like you've nailed it while studying or solving a problem or something then STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, that's all you can do. And remember what the seniors last year said about burn-out. At least wait til mid-terms before you do, in the very horrible event of its happening.

"           Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.

Kennedy has been an authority on employment for the last three decades.

Here is an excerpt from what Joyce had to say about Jobfiler.com:     NEW FREE ORGANIZER . A hard-charging job search generates scores of contacts each week. Effective follow-up depends upon keeping your records straight - contacts, names, dates, pitches, interviews, thank-you notes, previous follow-up and so forth.

"           'The space program is bullshit.' - Don't hold back, tell us how you really feel!  ;)  Seriously though, is it the whole space program or just this latest decision/pronouncement you don't like?  We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.         ",3

Your grandmother asks you to send her a JPEG file of your newborn so she can create a screen saver. You pull up in your own driveway and use your cell phone to see if anyone is home. Every commercial on television has a web site address at the bottom of the screen. You buy a computer and 3 months later it's out of date and sells for half the price you paid. Leaving the house  without your cell phone, which you didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go get it. Using real money, instead of credit or debit, to make a purchase would be a hassle and take planning. You just tried to enter your password on the microwave. You consider second-day air delivery painfully slow. Your dining room table is now your flat filing cabinet. Your idea of being organized is multiple-colored Post-it notes. You hear most of your jokes via e-mail instead of in person. You get an extra phone line so you can get phone calls. You disconnect from the Internet and get this awful feeling, as if you just pulled the plug on a loved one. You get up in the morning and go online before getting your coffee. You wake up at 2 AM to go to the bathroom and check your E-mail on your way back to bed. You start tilting your head sideways to smile. ) You're reading this and nodding and laughing. Even worse; you know exactly with whom you are going to share this...          ",0

"                 Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan... what we need now is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message.   Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic!)   I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for peace. So, here's one plan:   1. The US will apologize to the world for our 'interference' in their affairs, past &present. You know, Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Noriega, Milosovich and the rest of those 'good ole boys.' We will never 'interfere' again.   2. We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany, South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station troops at our borders. No one sneaking through holes in the fence.    3. All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave. We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would welcome them.   4. All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90 days unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself and don't hide here. Asylum would never be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers or 7-11 cashiers.   5. No 'students' over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't attend classes, they get a 'D' and it's back home baby.   6. The US will make a strong effort to become self-sufficient energy wise. This will include developing non-polluting sources of energy but will require a temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to cope for a while.   7. Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their oil. If they don't like it, we go some place else. They can go somewhere else to sell their production. (About a week of the wells filling up the storage sites would be enough.)   8. If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not 'interfere.' They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or whatever they need. Besides most of what we give them is stolen or given to the army. The people who need it most get very little, if anything.   9. Ship the UN Headquarters to an isolated island some place. We don't need the spies and fair weather friends here. Besides, the building would make a good homeless shelter or lockup for illegal aliens.   10. All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call us 'Ugly Americans' any longer.    Now, ain't that a winner of a plan.   'The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses.'

I called him a Nazi. He glared at me and started writing another ticket for having worn tires. So I called him a piece of horse s***.   He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket. This went on for about 20 minutes. the more I abused him, the more tickets he wrote.

"           It seems to me that neither Republicans nor Democrats ever really discuss what I would call politics.  For the record, I do not define the Lott issue as politics.  It's more like idle parlor talk.  Ideological masturbation.  I see no social or economic problem to solve by applying governmental political theory.  To me, it means nothing politically.  Emotionally, sure -- I can see it on that level.  Sociologically, certainly -- race is a fine subject for sociological study.  But politics?  I just don't see any point worth making on either ideological side.  Note that this is only only my opinion.  However, in the interests of idle parlor talk, I will toss this in the ring:  I perceive two kinds of racism.  First, conscious racism.  This is proactive, goal-oriented.  Extreme examples include hunting someone down and killing them, or burning crosses in yards.  It's fairly easy to spot, if only for its focused malignancy.  The second kind is similar in theme, yet very different.  I'll call it, for lack of a better term, unconscious racism.  Here, the person does not seek the destruction or expulsion of the group; he or she just sort of doesn't think about them much.  In fact, there isn't much thought at all.  This describes most of my immediate ancestors.  My grandmother, for example, would talk of 'colored' people in a way that meant no harm, but something in the tone suggested she unconsciously judged them by race.  There was no desire to actively seek out the race and destroy it; she was just -- well -- for lack of a better word -- naive and ignorant.  This does not make it right, but it is an important distinction.  Because in terms of Trent Lott, I have never perceived him as consciously, actively racist.  However, I have followed various biographies of him over the years, and heard him talk, and I have always felt comfortable that he fits well in the second category.  Not that he uses the word 'colored,' perhaps -- but there is a certain...well, naivete and ignorance in his words.  Case in point:  the birthday speech.  It seems to me that the words he chose revealed that mindless (rather than mindful) naivete and ignorance often exhibited by those who really haven't given the matter all that much thought.  This is not to say he is unintelligent, or evil, or good -- it's just an observation of his person.  Note that this is not observation of his *character*, which, for me, would not come into play unless he was in the first category, that of the conscious, ill-willed racist.  It seems to me that this is a man who isn't entirely on the ball about the whole race issue, and revealed his ambiguity (ambivalence?) through a naive and ignorant choice of words at the wrong time.  I do not condone what he said, nor do I praise it.  Ultimately it had absolutely no immediate impact on me.  I just watched the clip and thought 'Huh.  What an unfortunate place to utter such poorly thought-out words.'  All that said, to return to my original point -- it seems to me that so much more could be accomplished in this country if both Republicans and Democrats spent less time yammering on with all this ideological parlor talk and intellectual posturing, and focused all that mental energy on applying the broad range of available political philosophies to the immediate, tangible social, economic, and international issues that we as a society, a government, and a country would do well to confront.  There are real problems all around us.  Let's butt heads in a dialogue that matters, and work towards solutions that piss off all ideological sides just enough to the point that we're as close to the Truth as we can get.  I mean, come on, citizens.  Surely we're smarter than this.         ",2

It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          ",1

"              Visitation   Jennie and I attended the   visitation for the three people killed in the automobile crash this past Sunday .  It was a heart-wrenching experience.  The line to see and be with the dearly departed extended outside the funeral home.  As soon as we got to where the caskets were, I saw Kieran.  She was dressed in a nice outfit, wearing a baby hat.  A baby blanket was placed over her.  Sunday was her one-year old birthday.  She was born and she died on the same day, one year exactly.  We had met her parents before when they visited our church with Sarah and Bill.  Her parents are in their early to to mid twenties, and they remained beside her casket as people came in.  Kieran's mother clutched one of her daughter's stuffed toys, and both she and her husband openly wept aloud.  They said they were grateful that they had her for as long as they did, but it was obvious that there would still be a lot of grieving.  The next casket down was Sarah's.  She was only 22 years old.  It had been awhile since I'd last seen her.  I believe it was late last summer, at their oldest son Kade's 3 year old birthday party in a park.  The funeral home did a wonderful job with her makeup and outfit.  Yet, for some reason, I could tell she didn't look the same.  This gave me a little bit of an idea how horrific the accident was.  In the last casket was Hayden, Bill and Sarah's youngest son, 20 months old, born just six days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  He looked different, too from what I remember.  He was dressed in a 'little-man' outfit.  Bill remained by his and Sarah's caskets.  He said that he had been going through a cycle of emotions.  I told him that I didn't know what to say.  My mom had given me an envelope with some words she'd written for him.  I handed it to him, and he placed it in his suit jacket.  If there can be any good to come from this, it may be that the two babies never had an opportunity to grow up and reject God.  Sarah had been a disciple of Jesus Christ, and we can pray that her heart was right with God.  Inside the memorial flyers, along with the details of the three individuals, were two poems that I'm going to post:   Little Angels  and   I'm Free .         ",0

"              They sent us to our basement   This afternoon it rained hard.  We had a big thunderstorm come through.  I was brought to my senses when I heard the hail hitting our roof and looked out the window to see it streaming across the yard.  I walked to our covered porch to see how big the hail was.  At one point, I picked up a golf ball-sized piece.  Of course at that time, the local weathermen told us we needed to get to our basements because they had noticed some rotation in the cloud system, even though no funnels were created.  Just to be safe.  So we all went downstairs and sat on our bed and watched the progress of the thunderstorm on the local television station.  When it looked and sounded like the worst had passed I walked upstairs and outside to survey the area.  I called for everyone else to come up, too.  We saw lots of hail strewn around our yard, and it appears that the hood of mom's car was pelted with hail.  Other than that, everything looked okay.  Keisha walked around the yard, collecting pieces of hail in a plastic cup.  Then we all returned inside to the rest of our lives.         ",0

"           Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.           ",2

Sullen, Depressed President Retreats Into Private, Paranoid World    A sullen President George W. Bush is withdrawing more and more from aides and senior staff, retreating into a private, paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome.  Cabinet officials, senior White House aides and leaders on Capitol Hill complain privately about the increasing lack of 'face time' with the President and campaign advisors are worried the depressed President may not be up to the rigors of a tough re-election campaign.  'Yes, there are concerns,' a top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday. 'The George W. Bush we see today is not the same, gregarious, back-slapping President of old. He's moody, distrustful and withdrawn.'  Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House physician Col. Richard J. Tubb to put the President on powerful anti-depressant drugs after he stormed off stage rather than answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay, but White House insiders say the strong, prescription medications seem to increase Bush's sullen behavior towards those around him.  'This is a President known for his ability to charm people one-on-one,' says a staff member to House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert. 'Not any more.'   read the rest of this frightening article   here .           ",3

"       Let me start the second part of this long, long night with a song, because it IS going to be long, already.

One of them was for cutting and understand why they do it, and also to help them get over it. There were a few quotes from songs in there that relate to it, and one of them was:  Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive . So I thought about that. Then today, I was taking a nap and I remembered it and resolved to post it here. It sounds just like me.

But the thing is, it was really half-hearted, to the point where even I could take it that way, and second, when she's trying to shake me off, she'll use the phrase, 'Just move on,'.   I need some interpretations, by the way: 'It's going to be really funny when you find out you don't care about me.' and 'You lied; you said you loved me.'  Actually, I know what they both are quintessentially, 'I want attention', the Leigh Anne fling. It's amazing how desperately she needs it.  But right now she's talking to Brittany, and Brittany has a lot of sway over her, whether she'd like to admit it or not.  It's going to be a long night. This would've been longer had she not called back just now.  ARGH.  I'm weird, but my shirt smells really good right now.  HeeHAW.    ",4

Maybe it's because the movie is still fresh in my mind, but when I saw the name of the site, I thought of a Phoenix, namely the one named Fawkes, who was in the movie.  The picture on the O'Reilly book cover resembles the Phoenix from Harry Potter.  In one scene of the movie, the Phoenix dies and burns itself up.  Then it regenerates itself from the ashes.  It also did a number on the big snake during the climactic scene in the Chamber of Secrets, tearing its eyes out, rendering it blind.  Could this be more than a coincidence?  P.S.

For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

"           the circle of irony welcomes our two latest members: shannon erwin and johnathan 'better-late-than-never' shipley.  ;)  please see the prior notes about proper 'blogging' contained in prior posts - they're in the archive section now, but they're a good reference should you have any questions.    episode 3 news:  apparently there will be 'several' years between e2 and e3, and then 'about 20' years between e3 and e4.  luke and leia will appear as 'infants' in e3 (towards or at the end).  my rant:  i'm getting tired of CGI being used to create human or human-like creatures.  landscapes are OK, but CGI creatures are still just fancy cartoon characters.  until they're indistinguishable from 'actual' creatures, i can't take them seriously; i.e., they serve only as a clever but distracting talking head in what might be an otherwise serious scene.  if you're making a comedy and/or kids film (which may be all lucas is trying to do now), then perhaps this perspective is overly critical; but admittedly, i took the original trilogy to be a story somewhere between modern mythology and serious science fiction.  these films are something else; something modern, but not as deep, somehow.  thankfully, i didn't have to endure watching a cartoon lizard/rabbit thing step in feces this time, but i did get weary of the 'C-3PO has switched heads with another robot' gag.  yes, it was funny in the first scene where this occurs.  however, it ceases being funny by the fifth time that we're reminded, 'look!  C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          ",1

"       Hoo-ah, boys and girls!  So...yesterday Abby and I set a goal that I would finish  two  songs today...a challenge! Tho it should be easy enough. So I woke up early, got distracted by some mags for an hour or two...yes, that was a slight impediment to the plan, and if you knew what mags they were, I would be that much more smack-worthy. But nevertheless...I went upstairs after that, I sat down at the set, I laid it out, and it was, for lack of a better word, and at serious risk of being deemed a poser, DIBBLE.   The song is a year-old conception once called  These Chains . Back then, it was a lot softer and geared toward the wonderful artsiness of  Bitter , but now it's been a bit revamped, it sounds like really old Soundgarden, but...  OMG IT IS SOOOOO L337! I couldn't believe it when I'd finished all the myuzik tracks, it just blew me away. So ass-bad, the only problem is the lyrics...I haven't written any I like. I tried sitting down and writing some, I couldn't, so I gave up and went into some kind of stupor for an hour and laid around and beed a bum, then something got me up and made me record again.  The next one's drums were done in three takes. This song has also been conceptualized for a long time and finally laying it down is a dream come true, even if no one likes it...even I don't like it right now (needs remixing), but it's amazing to hear the idea in the flesh, even if it is a bit retarded in its present state. At least the idea was true to form, that's what counts. So it needs a bit of redesigning, but after that, it'll be one more under the belt, one more towards getting that free stizudio tizime, and one more towards submitting the record to some execs that Alex's dad knows that have expressed at least minute interest in hearing what we have to offer.   The songs, in order of recording, are  Chained  and  New Dawn , by the way, and I'm going to go record another, if I can, in a few minutes...need to run first, else this gut get control of me.  So enough recording stuff, it's more fun when you're hearing watching/doing it anyway...  A point to make...everyone says not eating is bad because it slows your metabolism and will actually make you gain weight. Everyone's heard it and it sounds essentially believeable...it's logical to the biology of humans, anyway. What gets me is...anorexics don't seem to be having this problem. This is also the concept behind the word 'starving', and the cartoon conceptualization thereby, where the character will tighten his belt to exemplify he isn't getting enough, if anything, to eat. So w00t, piss on science! This whole paragraph is just a reaction to the fact that I've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks and I have no idea why, heheh.  MTV is an awesome channel. Not really. There was a show on today about having 'THE PERFECT BODY', which featured a bunch of prep girls and jocks that did inane stuff to get what they call 'perfect figure'. There were two guys...one was a bodybuilder, the other was a soon-to-be linebacker for Notre Dame. Then the girl, who was in a modeling convention where, honestly, she didn't stand a chance. One girl said, before the competetion, 'I don't think they'll even be judging us on how we answer the questions, it's all about having a great bod, right?'   Right. One of the judges had the audacity to say 'it's important that they answer the questions well and without hesitation'. Oh, so is that why you made them walk to the awards ceremony in bikinis? RIGHT, their intelligence has a lot to do with that, etc. blahblahblah, and other cynicisms about this 'pop culture' shiet.  But jeez, that show is really depressing. No one gets what they're going for...the bodybuilder guy placed third, he needed first to go pro, the girl didn't even place, the linebacker was thirteen pounds too light to match the smallest linebacker Notre Dame has had in the last five years. And the guy weights 280, for cryin' out loud.  The world is really gay, when you think about it. That's why I don't; consequently, this abscence of culture is good fodder for lyrical dissection.  That'll be one of those quotes that people will put in inspirational books for musicans, if not this line that you're presently reading, just because they're smartasses.  Anyway kids...need to go run. You've been an excellent audience as always, if you've made it this far, and if you skipped all the way down here, well, good for you too!  PEACE DAWGZ, AWW W00T.    ",4

"           Well, since I am the only one on the right remaining on the blog, I'll give you my opinion.  As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         ",3

She writes:    Clever connection to California. I have mixed feelings about the whole ADHD thing.  First of all, pregnant women in the 8th - 9th month should continue to eat lots of veggies, when their child's brains are developing.    Secondly,  ADHD & ADD are often used as excuses by parents to not offer their children a structured life including discipline & feeling the consequences of their behaviour.  So, quite frankly, from a teacher's perspective, I am skeptical of most people who label their kids with either one.   Yes, their is a grain of reality in the 'disorder.'  :)           ",0

Occasionally, when someone hits a tremendous golf shot, a partner will exclaim 'out of this world!' The first and only golf shots really made out of this world occurred on this day in 1971. Astronaut Alan Shepard brought a six-iron he had stashed away aboard his Apollo spacecraft down to the surface of the moon and swung at three golf balls. He whiffed the first swing, but considering the bulkiness of his spacesuit, his others resulted in good shots. None of them went into orbit, however. Here on earth, nearly 27 million people play golf every year, making the rounds on some 15,500 courses, about two-thirds of them open to the public.

"             I having trouble staying awake to type this blog post.  What a day.  This morning Jennie caught the bus to a podiatrist follow-up appointment.  She left before Keisha left for school.  Shortly after that, two contractors arrived to fix a leaking problem we've had near our storm patio door.  They removed the entire assembly and added some flashing.  I had to leave for work before they were finished.  They locked up when they were done.  I rode the bike to work, listening to my new MP3 player along the way.  Music and cycling go together like peas and carrots.  I arrived at work almost 15 minutes late, and I hit the ground running.  After we'd switched from the breakfast to lunch menu, our crew trainer asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the grill.  Not many hands went up, so I volunteered.  That meant that, from 10:45 to 3 I was non-stop at the grill.  Because of how my schedule is set up, I do not often get sent on a break, especially when the restaurant is hoppin' busy.  I left work at 3 and rode the bike home.  I showered -- much needed from sweat and the general 'working around a grill' smell.  Afterward, Jennie and I watched 'A Beautiful Mind', which we'd checked out recently from the library.  Having seen it, I now understand why it was so critically acclaimed two years ago and why it won so many Academy Awards.  We ate dinner, and Jennie went to bed for awhile before she had to get ready to go to work.  Keisha and I cleaned up.  After that, I grabbed my guitar and started strumming, practicing, whatever you want to call it.  Keisha requested that I play 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing', which is in one of the songbooks I borrowed from the library.  I showed her how to follow along with the words as I played.  That was fun.  I tried 'Down By The Riverside', but she wasn't as interested in singing along.  Then I sat down and played this song called 'The Window', which I got out of a campfire songbook, which I, of course, borrowed from the library.  'The Window' takes the first couple of lines from a nursery rhyme and ends it with 'out the window.  For example  Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went She threw it out the window  The window, the window The second story window If you don't know your nursery rhymes We'll throw you out the window  You do this with as many nursery rhymes as you can remember.  We did 'Humpty Dumpty' and 'Three Little Kittens', too.  Then I played 'Down by the Bay', which I had first heard from Raffi about seven years ago.  It's one of those 'add a verse' songs, too.  For instance  Down by the bay Where the watermelons grow Back to my home I dare not go For if I do My mother will say:  Did you ever see a goose Kissing a moose?  Down by the bay  Keisha and I would take turns with the rhyming part.  She started getting really goofy by coming up with her own rhyming words for stuff.  After she'd say her part, she'd crack up laughing.  That was so much fun.  Finally, I put the guitar away, and we snuggled up on the couch to finish this book we'd checked out from the library.  It's a children's poetry book entitled    Love That Dog  .  I read most of the words for time's sake, but I let Keisha read some bits and pieces.  It was a really good book.  It's a story about a young student named Jack who is exploring poetry and, in looking for inspiration, finds it in a dog.         ",0

"           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

While her tormentors take a break, she finds herself alone in a room with a figure curled under a bloodstained sheet. When Dianna pulls back the sheet, there is a woman who 'opens her eyes, and they are light brown in the black and blue of her face. Her teeth appear in the crack of her swollen lips. She is trying to smile. I catch a sob in my throat and gently take her hand. Her breasts have been cut, and maggots are crawling in them.' The woman asks Dianna's name, and says 'Dianna, be strong.'

"           There definitely are, but it's a question of 'filling in the gaps.' Sometmes I don't have enough work for a 40 hour week, while some weeks I put in 60+ hours. And the way I look at it, I need some alternative methods to make cash when things are slow for a day or two. Plus, there's actually advantages to having this type of work - when the time's up, you're done - unlike articles and interviews, which mean more cash but drag on for days and weeks. The one bonus of this, I think, is getting the work over and done with - eating dinner at 6 o'clock with a clear mind, knowing that everything's done and a check is going out of Friday.

Friends want friends around, and if they really don't, then they really don't want to be friends at all. Something, but not friends.  And friends listen to others.

Because they never die.  The funny thing about any problem I have is, none of them are bad at all anymore. The thing is, they're just so well timed. Things are good for me and suddenly it's a one-two punch and it all falls down again, I think it's not going to be that way for much longer, I see myself looking at these things as no surprise, and with no more surprises, they'll just stop happening.

"              You Can't Take Me Clothes Shopping   I don't go clothes shopping often.  It shows.  I don't care.  Being married has meant that my wife helps pick out clothes for me.  I don't like spending money on myself for clothes.  I have a big problem with that.  I'm not that good at it, and I can think of a lot of other things I'd rather do.  As   I mentioned earlier , Jennie packed up a lot of my clothes and we donated them to Goodwill.  This, of course, meant that I needed some new threads.  Jennie, before heading to work this morning, mentioned that Wal*Mart is a good place.  I agreed, but I wasn't that hip to going clothes shopping all by myself.  At about 11 AM this morning, I mentioned to my mom that I was considering grabbing some lunch and heading to Wal*Mart.  I promoted the idea to Keisha by saying that we could look in the toy department at stuff she might want for her birthday.  Mom wasn't feeling that well, so it would have to be just Keisha and I for the trip.  We wound up doing what I mentioned earlier, instead (see '  Her First Time In A Bar - Sort Of ').  I knew that if it was just Keisha and I along for the trip, we'd wind up spending the entire time in the toy area.  Which leads me back to why I love my wife.  She has the style, the panache, the desire, really - to go clothes shopping for me.  I find it boring.  I like getting new clothes, don't get me wrong.  I just don't like the process of getting new clothes.  As usual, I sought for ways to see humor in the situation.  Two things came to mind.  First, I immediately noticed that between the Men's clothing department and the Men's dressing room was the Women's underwear section.  (snicker)  I told the attendant that I'd thought about grabbing me a piece of women's underwear to try on with my shorts and other stuff.  She said, 'I wouldn't stop you, if that's what you REALLY want to do.'  I also mentioned this to Jennie, to see what kind of reaction this would get out of her.  Secondly, as I was trying on a pair of shorts, I felt the urge to break wind.  I hurriedly got out of the shorts and did my business, trying hard to be discreet.  But that got me wondering, how many other men had tried on that same pair of shorts and broke wind in them?  Have you ever thought of that?

Today was cool because I walked about two miles down the road and went to a Piggly Wiggly, where I bought a Vanilla and Cherry Coke, respectively. The people eyed me with suspicion, and I eyed them back. I had the luck of having Alex call me on my cell right when I got there. A word of advice, guys, don't go into a frequently-robbed East Nashville store wearing an American Eagle T-shirt and carrying a cellphone. They  rape  and  rob  little preppy bitches like that...which would include me, I guess.  I'm going to put a segment on my site soon called ' The Ultimate Survival Guide For The White Man In East Nashville ', with pictures and such. For example: if you are part of the KKK and wish to rally, don't do it here. The black population outnumbers you at least ten to one. Don't even dress up in a ghost costume over here; that little red dot on you forehead isn't a hornet...you can trace it back to the barrel of that elephant rifle that a very pissed off black man is holding.  I also watched golf today, where I witness Tiger Woods use the taboo phrase 'goddamn' on national television after a bad drive. I also made fun of Ernie Els for looking like he'd been partially decapitated in the past. Look at the guy sometime. He's got two huge gashes in the left side of his neck.   Tiger is losing bad, by the way. He looks like he's on the verge of tears constantly. Els sucks too, and there was a commercial on him about him being really bad ass and winning a thousand championships, one with a spiked club up his ass, etc., I was expecting more out of the guy. Meanwhile, some guy that looks like Hitler was cleaning up for a while, and then he started sucking as soon as I honed in on the fact that the Nazis haven't done any earth-shaking work since the end of WWII. And watch Will prove me wrong on that one.  THEN, I turned on Univision. OH MY  GOD . Have you people watched the news on that channel. OH GOD! First, there was this lady beating this shit out of her kid, whacking it over the head twice really hard while it was crying. And then she took it out of its highchair and threw it straight on the ground. I was sitting there with my mouth open for about five minutes. As if that wasn't bad enough, they had a segment which I loosely translated as 'Shocking Videos'. They showed the baby one again first. Ok, seen that, still scary. Then they showed this guy on a balcony in an apartment complex with a .45 against his head. A cop from the floor above tried to jump him and missed, landing in the shrubbery below. THE GUY BLEW HIS FUCKING BRAINS OUT, RIGHT THERE. All over the wall! On TV! And this shit is for real? There there was a vid of a black guy or something resisting arrest, he pulled away from two cops trying to cuff him and pulled a knife or something. Then he turned his back and walked away, and the cops shot the shit out of him til he fell over in a pool of blood, crimson spurting from the fresh and burning wounds. It was really outrageous, so I decided to watch the CKY vids by Bam Margera, freshly downloaded. WHOOPS! More outrageous shit than before, on and on and on and on, and I watched all of it. I must say, today has been a really screwed up day.   And I'm all alone .

And why did you count them as allies? You would only need those if you were fighting a war...  I personally don't feel these things, which is why I'm still making posts, but that's my observation right there, uniting against the common cause. To defeat it?

"       Tidings, all, and a Bon Mardi Gras, tout le monde.  Today was a great day, and it was all because of outside. The climate was simply stupefying, and it cleared up a lot of accumulated woe over the past few days. And it looks like a light rain tonight which should be nice, as long as it clears up by tomorrow.  And, I should be audioblogging starting this Sunday, if all goes to plan. I get my ten dollars allowance, nine of that goes to BLog and I get twelve calls a month at three dollars a month for three months. So I'll be set for a while. Then, with the next three weeks' allowance, I'm saving to buy Jerry's new album,  Degradation Trip Volumes One and Two , which features all of the  Degradation Trip  songs and eight new ones, including  Hurts Don't It? ,  Sidhartha ,  Pig Charmer , which is about Layne, whose deathday is coming up with Kirt Cobain's this April 5th, and others. It promises to be a great album, and I can hardly wait a month to get it.  To the thing I found fascinating tonight:  I was taking a bath just for the sake of soaking. I was ultimately tired and looking for something relaxing to do to ease my caffeine-induced body, and I happened to come upon the idea of taking a bath. It's been a while, but in I went, turning the water to a flinching degree of heat. I slipped in a sat for a while, then became bored and got out. Then I took the towel to myself.  The towel, that was the thing.  This was a new towel...at least, new to the upstairs shower. The main one is a thick, blue monstrosity, reeking of long-washed out cat urine as they had the gumption to find the towel fallen in the tub and somehow took it as their perogative to piss upon it. Past the ammonitic smell, it is also quite cumbersome and takes quite a long time to dry, so naturally every time it is used, the new towelee takes a goodly amount of time in getting dry, as the towel is already soaking. So, what a surprise to find this towel, one stictched by my parental step-grandmother for my mother ages ago, with half the personalization stitches ripped out by my mother for some reason or another ('MA', it reads).  But I took the towel about me, at first not noticing the difference, and then inhaling slightly...no cat piss. It was an oddity, but I chanced a downward look and found that all-too-familiar half-gone stitch of 'MARY'.   Another whiff smelled of cologne...what is this,  Grey Flannel ?  That Man ? It was my dad's old cologne.   It reminded me of warm summer days where five year old boys would wake up and waste that same day in front of a Nintendo-stricken TV, but nonetheless make the entire day worth it, because he was busy having too much fun to notice the outside. And all the while, his father next to him, only a few feet away, sitting leisurely in a creaking office chair with sunlight illuminating his face from below, pouring in through three windows in the room, and each was open, giving off a scent of tree and grass and sun and wind and sky, and his father was languidly staring at a computer screen, sometimes looking interesting, sometimes laughing at some joke of his son's, or one of his rantings about losing his Nintendo game. Then the evenings came, and the boy would go outside and the summer was suddenly around him everywhere he walked, and it was pure heaven to run in that slighty humidified but sweet air. It was summer, he was young, and the world was something else every single time.  And then, I turned the towel and I smelled the sea.  Sea salt, sand, it was Florida, and the same boy, although he was older now, his face a little bolder, his frame a little taller, and he was laughing with his cousin and sister as he ran into the waves, choking on rushing salt water and still wide-mouthedly howling with mirth. It was sunset, and here the boy found what he thought was love for the first time with a girl he had met there, and they drew hearts in the sand all the way down the beach. Eventually, the girl would leave and, in a trail of hearts, the boy was applauded by all on the quieting beach, cheering and wooping, clapping and general appreciation at the sight of young love, a sign that the whole world was just fine. He would never see the girl again for the rest of his time there, and three years later, when he saw her again, she remembered him with a shy smile and restrained glances, saying little and blushing much, staying near him but keeping her distance, and this time there was only one heart in the sand, hers, a farewell present to the boy, who, knowing this time, would never glimpse the face again.  And as the boy types he cannot remember her face but he can remember that day all too well, the day he figured out that there was something to the idea of love, something fascinating, that while it ends one day, while it is there, it is magic, forbidden and wonderful magic, the sort that actually  does  inspire men to jump cliffs and float all the way down, to run fire, skip sea, dance sky, slide earth, it moves him to hysteria, and in it he is content, and all around him are somehow not illed by this flagrant show of emotion, but somehow wryly enriched at seeing it; there is love, so powerful a force, so fleeting, but yet it strikes with the fury of colliding worlds and the quickness of cobras made of lightning.   What a strange fate to have had a towel and remember the two best times in my entire life.  It was warm, then.    ",4

"       Well Linds gave me an eight...C'MON LINDS! Thanks, but seriously...it was still a meld of all of the writing I've ever done and the 'new writing' we're supposed to be doing...the kind that's very sure of itself and stupid, in my opinion. I mean, I just don't think it's right to opinionize on something and think of it as 'true'. What if you don't have an opinion one way or the other? Perhaps it's a hybrid of two opinions?  College=REALLY GAY. But Linds gave me an eight and I was incredibly stoked/a bit smug/highly disbelieving.    THANKS LINDS!!!!     And wow, on another note...I got PWNED last night...so did Abby and Kyndall and Chad, for that matter.  So here we are sitting in the park, fresh off listening to the worst jazz duet that hath ever drawn life into thine lungs, and the production is about to begin...for those of you who don't know, a troupe performs Shakespeare in Centennial Park every year. The whole deal is really huge and it's been going on for about sixteen years now. But anyway. I need to give a bit of background on the area.  It's a small, spraypaint constructed amphitheater...as in, there's a full-size, constructionized stage, but the rest of it is grass, except at the back, where there's some bleachers. So basically, you set yourself up within the confines of these spraypainted boundaries. These are set up so that the actors can walk down the stage, and so that they can store equipment in the audience and hopefully no one will touch it.  One of these pieces of equipment is a light display. It's a giant metal box connected to a skinny pole that has about two hundred pounds of lighting on the top. This, the stage lights, and another of the same kind of light at the other side of the area, allow you to see the actors.   In addition, there were some mounted power woofers on stands so that you can hear what's going on thru the power condenser house microphones on-stage.   Also keep in mind that the house mic is VERY strong and could pick up a cricket chirping a very long way off and make it sound HUGE.  So the play begins with the speech from the chorus, because it is Shakespeare and the play was Romeo and Juliet. Unfortunately for us, there's a big black storm rolling in from the north very fast. Not only this, the speech from the chorus is becoming increasingly more gothic-sounding as it goes to the point of fear. And all the while the house mics are picking up the most ghastly sounds of wind...I didn't know it at the time, but Abby and I both figured it was some effect they were using to make it more goth and stuff.  But there was a bed, and the curtains were blowing like no other. I thought it was a fan or something. Right before it all happened, tho, it got about ten degrees colder in about two seconds and I guess we all knew that the shit was about to hit the fan. It was  cold .  During recording, every once in a while, a wire will get exposed and create a distinct pitch of feedback thru every available speaker in the vicinity.   Remember those lights that I was talking about? At the end of the speech there was a torrent of wind like no other...the only problem was, we felt it as well as heard it, and in that same moment that little feedback came up and we saw the lights topple and fall smack damn in the middle of the crowd.  We were sitting pretty much next to them. The light wavered in mid fall and time stood still for a second, amidst the screams and monkey-panic of the moment. I think that someone got hit by the tail end of the light, or maybe they were just too freaked and passed out. But at least no one was crushed flat by the damned thing. But damn.   That's when we decided, 'HEY, what a great time to leave,'. I found out this morning that FIVE people were struck by lightning in the same area last night.  We had two choices, to stay in Nashville and duck it out, or to try and brave the interstate in the midst of the storm, and Nashville for that matter. Abby pointed out the fact that some people were heading to a building next to the Parthenon and it didn't seem like such a bad idea. But I figured we should just try and get through it all, like an idiot. Not that we died, it was just a trying experience.  So here we go down the mean streets of Nashvegas in pre-storm. It wasn't coming down just yet but it might as well have been; everyone was freaking out and driving like bums. So we whipped out the cellphones and got to it...we got separated from Kyndall and Chad at a red when I got trapped behind some bum in an Acura, and I would have pranced around the biotch and dashed the light had I not known Nashville drivers in general...altho running the light sort of would have made me one...but whatever, we were panicking, getting separated was really bad. So I called my dad and asked him what the hell I should do, he said stay on the street I was going on and turn right on the interstate. I was able to get over but first I got cut off...bastards.   I could try and detail the aftermath but I can't tell you in words about the drive thru that storm on the interstate...it was some fear I've never known. We had the radio on and it would flicker with every lightning strike, and the rain...I could have pulled over, yes, but I trust being stopped on the Nashville interstate less than I do moving on the Nashville interstate. I just follow the red lights in front of me and hoped to God we would make it.  I could attribute two things to my success. The minor one was Kyndall's incredibly sugared tea...it was really good. And I think the caffeine kept me just that much more hyped to avoid being pwned by that semi at one point.   And the other, and the major one, was having Abby next to me...suddenly she took my hand and I was moved beyond all reason with nerve and the want to defend her. I've never been so inspired to courage as at that moment...it was me feeling helpless and doing it anyway, because it was incredibly worth it. Not that we were going to die, but it was lingering about the doorstep at every second, you hear stories about it all the time. What could I say that could do justice to her in that moment, or ever? I love her.  So we made it and I was a wreck from all the concentration. I turned off the car and didn't put it in park, for starters. I had a Sprite when I got inside: it was ambrosia. Chad went out to the car and got the food we didn't eat at the park...none of it, in fact. Poor guy...it was his birthday yesterday, he wouldn't let us do anything. I offered to go get it, he refused, he said he wasn't going to milk it for everything it was worth...as if he milked it at all, for cryin' out loud. So that was really sad. Then while in the bathroom, the power went out. And thus begins another story. But not right now, for cryin' out loud.  For cryin' out loud.   What a great/weird night...I hope I never have to do that again, or if I do, I hope I have such good motivators.  I'm going to play the guitar now and write pretty songs about love and how good it is to be alive, and the next album has been renamed  Love Poem About Flowers and Rabbits and Sunshine , because one thing that that motivates you to live more than death is flirting with it and coming out on top.  And now that the mellodrama is done, I wish you all a fraggin' GREAT day. PEACE.      ",4

The reason she is so sad is because I'm so sick. I was born without a body. It doesn't hurt, except when I try to breathe. The doctors gave me an artificial body.  It is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that was the best they could do on account of us having no money or insurance. I would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money. Mommy doesn't work because she said nobody hires crying people.  I said, 'Don't cry, Mommy,' and she hugged my burlap bag.

Maybe one day I will be able to play baseball. Right now I can only be third base.  Every time you forward this letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels and my dream will be closer to coming true. Please help me.  Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves to rot before I turn 10.  If you don't forward this email, that's okay. Mommy says you're mean and heartless. One who doesn't care about a poor little boy with only a head.

"              Huge Wins for the Cincinnati Reds and Dayton Dragons   Both Cincinnati and Dayton have something to be excited about as we head into Independence Week.  Today's   Dayton Daily News reports  that yesterday the   Reds  (43-37, or a .5375 winning percentage) came within percentage points of tying the   St. Louis Cardinals  (42-36, or a .5384 winning percentage) for first place in the National League Central Division.  The Reds, you may recall, were predicted not to amount to much in the preseason.  Yet they have not given up and are part of what hopes to be an exciting pennant race for the second half of the baseball season.  Part, if not most, of the reason the Reds are doing so well may be in the young talent they have raised up from their minor league affiliates.  Why, it was only recently, when Adam Dunn, Austin Kearns, and Juan Encarnacion were playing A-ball for the   Dayton Dragons  in at Fifth Third Field.  Now look at these guys.    Adam Dunn was the only Cincinnati Red chosen for the All-Star team .  Austin Kearns   could be Rookie of the Year .  And what of those   Dayton Dragons ?  Today's   Dayton Daily News also reports  that the Dragons, with a 4-3 victory over the Fort Wayne Wizards yesterday, have extended their winning streak to 13 games.  One has to wonder if this is the same team that was in second-to-last place after the first half of the season.  Now, since the beginning of the second half, with a clean slate, the Dragons are hot!  It seems that everything is coming together for the minor league team: pitching, fielding, and hitting.  One player of note is outfielder Chris Williamson.  In his last three games he has produced three homers and 12 RBIs to go with a .415 batting average.  Even with all the great things happening for the team, the players are still forced to keep things in perspective.  As Williamson puts it: 'We're not all here about winning championships.  We're here to develop players.'  We certainly have witnessed the results in Dunn, Kearns, and Encarnacion.  Keep it up, guys.  I certainly am enjoying it.         ",0

What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers? On the positive site, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems. But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline. There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment. The results could be quite interesting.      ",0

"       For fun, I never responded to it and it was an interesting thread. And I was really bored and lonely in the library that day.  Well antiphilanthropists, well......  It's all coming to a head. If you read my post in 'The Blog' yesterday (which is probably when you'll be reading this), then you'll know what I'm talking about in this post. I really need to stress the pointlessness in having this get-together this weekend.  Let me put it this way, and I'm sure everyone can agree. If you thought for one minute that I would ever agree with someone else's opinion that wasn't entirely like mine when it came to this matter, you are wrong, dead wrong. If I had to pick a solution to this problem, I would take plan number one (mentioned by Lindsey), because if Rosie and Becca have some time to cool their jets they might actually be those adults we're wanting them to be and this situation will close like a storybook. If we let them have at it and try to interject, someone is going to say something they might regret, and it might just cause not only Rosie and Becca to fall apart, but the rest of us as well.   If you're really planning to follow through on this, please remember: one, try to keep your head; two, I am behind those of you who would do as such one hundred thousand percent, and will certainly be there when it happens; and three, no matter what I say, and no matter what is said to me, each and every one of you will still be some of the best friends I have ever had; I'm not quite sure anyone realizes what an impact each of you have made on what I've become, and GOD forbid I'd ever forget that.  And now that the sentimentality is over, we await the bomb to go off, watching the timer as it clicks down to total oblivion...or maybe the fuse is faulty; but in the end, only time will tell.  Just like everything else, only time will tell.    ",4

"              Depressing Day in the Journey   I've had a rough day.  I came home from work last night and got on the computer.  I was on the computer for three hours, and during that time I took my shoes and socks off and began scratching my left foot and ankle.  I scratched really hard, breaking skin.  At the time it didn't hurt much, but, as the day progressed, it has.  I finally went to bed at around 5 AM this morning, taking the Lexapro, the antidepressant which is supposed to set my brain up with more seratonin.  It's the seratonin that is supposed to help me with the depression and self-injurious tendencies.  I slept for a few hours before Keisha woke up to get ready for a morning doctor's appointment.  Jennie had today off, so she got Keisha ready.  I fell back to sleep until Jennie returned home, a little after noon.  I took Jake for a walk.  I heard from Jennie that the pediatrician has concluded that Keisha has the weight of a 14 year old and the height of an 8 year old.  She's 112 pounds and a little over 4 feet tall.  She's only 6 years old.  As I began to realize that I've been responsible for my daughter's physical condition, I got depressed.  I realize that if we continue living how we've been living, she'll have a lot of health problems in the future.  I feel like I could be killing my own daughter if I don't do something.  I spent a little time remembering how she was as an infant, toddler, and younger girl.  She's already getting teased by other kids about her weight.  Jennie mentioned that her pediatrician wants us to meet with a nutritionist soon.  I know that we'll have to make some lifestyle changes, and it feels overwhelming right now.  Also, we've been getting daily phone calls from the company we have our car loan with.  We haven't made a payment in a few months.  They're talking about pursuing 'recovery action'.  I know I need to call them, but I don't really know what to say.  I feel a little down at how much my life has changed.  In a way, I long for the time when work was more steady, we could pay our bills, and life seemed a lot more manageable.  I feel like I just want to retreat into a cocoon and stay there until spring.         ",0

The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

"       Still depressed eh...  You know...the best advice I ever got while being depressed came from that self-help book. I don't know if this applies at all, or if you're willing to accept it, because I have no idea about this situation, but the majority of the book deals with being able to accept the fact that we can't change people, only that we can accept ourselves. And I don't know why, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made until depression isn't really hard to deal with anymore. Well it depends on the dosage, and the time of day and how drunk I am. But whatever, I'd bet that book would help out a lot, if you'd like.  I was up until 4 this morning playing Snake 2 on my dad's cell and staring absently at the ceiling, listening to the storm outside, and beforehand, a series of booms that definitely weren't thunder because they kept answering each other, but sounding like it still. And of course, nobody else heard them. They weren't on the news. Fireworks, maybe? Those were some fireworks, just cuz of how fast they were going off. And considering that yesterday was...July 29 WOOT, what a festive day....  I was awake because I had become just physically addicted enough to NyQuil to become a tad impaired in the sleep department. And then I had to wake up at six to take my da to work. So blah, tons of morning [sic]ness. But I got over that fast enough, and we drove down Woodland Avenue to his office; I've never been that way before, but there's some awesome stuff on Woodland Ave. Like, awesome shops and stuff. It's awesome. So I'm hoping to get the car tomorrow and go check it out.    Casablanca  is SUCH a badass movie...but the ending! It sucks! RAGH! It's a freaking oldie, there's supposed to be only good endings on those suckers. WAAAAAAAAHHHH. That was me crying for the end of said movie. Dude, Humphrey Bogart is such a pimp. As stated on Linds's BLog, I am going to become him from now on. It is thus that you will see me about school walking around in Italian leisure wear, drinking lots of bourbon and smoking expensive cigarettes, and generally being a badass...and Abby's going to hate me, heheheh. But perhaps the suave charm of my being Humphrey will help her ignore the kinky haircut and alchoholic drool smell that follows me everywhere, and the poss and whatnot. Ok, I can't do it, so what. God knows I'm not charming. Nor can I afford a constant supply of bourbon and cigs, or be able to pay off all the teachers to allow me to intake such pleasures in their classrooms.   Well, I can always dream...  And kids, guess what...only two weeks 'til school starts. YIPPEE! I'm excited. Not really. My drum teacher had Mrs. Bayrd when he was in BHS...when I said I was taking AP US History, he asked the teacher...I didn't remember, he looks at me and says 'Bayrd?'...I nodded, he gave me the 'Shall I get the shells or do you have some in your pocket' look. So I'm excited, once again. Apparently he walked right the hell out of her classroom because he didn't like her. Hell yah JD. And that's what I'm probably going to do because, bygod, I intend to not work as much as possible this year and get by. Even tho I brought all this on my self. I don't care anymore, at all. I have lost every will to be better than anyone at anything, to stand out academically, to be renowned as smart.  I've lost it. And it feels wonderful.  I mean sure, I'll still go about respecting basic school rules and stuff. But past that, I don't care. Homework can go suck an egg. So can this dumb essay for that matter.   Wow, I'm going to fail, that's great.  Well...heheheh. There's a bit of work in store, I have a feeling that I'll be doing better this year, coming in with a lot less on my mind as last year. But I intend not to stress, and I encourage all of you to follow suit. Altho that's entirely wasted on Rosie but Lord knows I've tried.  Going to play some CS and clock out. Bon voyage, kids!     ",4

Who knows what's happening.  Anyway, please say a prayer for my parents' good friend, Christy Stickney.  She has leukemia and just got a bronchial infection (which, most of you [except Z] probably don't know, totally lowers your immune system because leukemia attacks your blood cells and bone marrow.)  They were going to do a bone marrow transplant, but now she's so weak they can't do it.  She's probably not going to be with us much longer.  And that's about it for me.  All I do now is sleep.  On the bright side though, I have lost about eight pounds in a little less than a week.  Can't complain too much about that, now can I?  The best part though, is that I have a bet going on with my mother to see who can lose ten pounds the fastest.  I win!!!  Bad thing though, is that she'll probably say the bet is off cause I cheated by getting sick.  So, yall have a good weekend.  See you sometime in February I hope.  Probably can't go to my HUGE forensics tournament in Gatlinburg, which REALLY PISSES ME OFF, but I'm getting over it.  Slowly.  Rosie, have a good time at Mystery dinner tomorrow night.  And Elizabeth, I hear you're sick so GET BETTER OR CALL ME!!!  There's no excuse for lying in that bed bored when your best friend is at home in the same condition!!!  I'll call you tomorrow afternoon, though.  Hope to hear from yall soon, and yall BETTER HAVE A DI MEETING BEFORE I COME BACK!!!!

"        Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at   FranklinCovey     Feedback-Feast on It!   Today's special-feedback.  Sound good?  Asking for and receiving feedback requires a generous portion of humility.  Although it's hard to swallow sometimes, feedback tells you as much about the people from whom you receive it as it does about yourself.  Hungry for more?  Here are some ideas to chew on:   Large selection. Concentrate on your roles in your family, work, or community where you feel additional perspective would be helpful.  For example, parents could get feedback from children, a spouse, or other parents.  Different tastes.   Feedback can be formal or informal, anonymous or face-to-face.  You can use a questionnaire or just chat on the phone.  You know what's best for you.  Ingredients.   Be careful not to judge each other's character.  Feedback should be objective, and given against performance and effectiveness criteria.  Dish it out.   As soon as you receive feedback, analyze it and feed it back!  Involve others in creating an action plan based on their feedback.  Remember your manner and always say 'Thanks.' Come on, try it.  You'll like it!    ",0

"           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.

Mir - I answered the first question in my previous post.  In an ideal world, I would answer affirmatively to the second question.  This is not an ideal world, and proactive goodwill is not inherent to our species, so some socially-agreed upon governmental action is necessary to ensure temporary aid is provided for those who cannot help themselves.

It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents).

"           John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.         ",1

"           Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when  they lit a fire in the craft, it sank - proving once  and for all that you can't have your kayak and heat  it, too.   Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina. One went  to Hollywood and became a famous actor. The other  stayed behind in the cotton fields and never amounted  to much. The second one, naturally, became known as  the lesser of two weevils.   A three-legged dog walks into a saloon in the Old  West. He sidles up to the bar and announces: 'I'm  looking for the man who shot my paw.'   This guy goes into a restaurant for a Christmas  breakfast while in his home town for the holidays.  After looking over the menu he says, 'I'll just have  the eggs Benedict.' His order comes a while later and  it's served on a big, shiny hubcap. He asks the  waiter, 'What's with the hubcap?' The waiter sings,  'O, there's no plate like chrome for the hollandaise!'    When she told me I was average, she was just being  mean.   A neutron goes into a bar and asks the bartender, 'How  much for a beer?' The bartender replies, 'For you, no  charge.'   Two atoms are walking down the street and they run  into each other. One says to the other, 'Are you all  right?' 'No, I lost an electron!' 'Are you sure?'  'Yeah, I'm positive!'

Even the king of the jungle knows that readers digest  and writers cramp.   There was a man who entered a local paper's pun  contest.

"       Thieves.  It came to pass that after seeing  Phone Booth  with a few friends on Saturday, I went to a the best take-out Chinese restaurant in Nashville, Hunan Express, where I got a Hunan-style beef and two egg rolls. But that's besides the point. As I was driving home, my dad beside me and I at the wheel, I drove by 'the car'.  This car has been sitting here since two summers ago. It's an old blue car, it looks sort of like the Shelby from  Gone In Sixty Seconds , and it is in the worst possible position, half-way on the road at the veritable apex of the curve leading to my dad's house. As we drove by, I told my dad my plans for my sixteenth birthday in two months: I'm going to drive the car to the very place I was presently at in that road, take a crowbar, and bash that thing until it was little more than a crushed Pepsi can. Suddenly my dad became very somber while saying, 'You could put that to a more practical use,' We pulled into the driveway.  As we sat there, he said, 'What's different?' After making several guesses about a change to the house, even being so optimistic as to infer that something had been done to the house: he said it was something bad. After further pushing, he told me: someone had stolen my bike.  I didn't ride the bike much, I was going to when I first bought it, but it needed a lot of work and no one was really listening to me when I said as such; plus, this summer gave me little incentive to do so: this of course, is the reason why I didn't notice it at first. Afterward, my dad gave me the speculation that someone had cut the padlock and taken not only the bike, but the broken padlock and chain as well. I was stunned at first, then I was angry, and almost backed out of the drive to start looking: my dad informed me that he had already been doing that since it had been stolen...  But the bigger suprise: it happened while I was in Destin, on Thursday, he even heard it when it happened and disreguarded it. It  was  a pretty quiet neighborhood, I thought as I walked inside. Of course, to add insult to injury, as we were watching TV that night, a white Cavalier was being pursued by three blazing police cars. My dad and I gave each other a look, whereafter he took his gun from his backpack, unbuttoned the fasten for the holster, put it down on the coffee table, and continued watching our  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  second season on DVD, woot!  That is a pretty good show, by the way.  Which is better: to be optimistic, or to be realistic? Optimism for comfort, realism for reality. Is reality such a good thing? Is it even necessary anymore? Humanity subverts its reality with TV and video games, with the Internet, they subvert their love with pornography, they subvert their beliefs with the good guys in the movie, they are serial murderers with a license to kill, they are puppeteers with the right to control humans as they see fit. It really leaves one to wonder if the world should be entirely optimistic, because, truly, their is no more reality to address.  We can make our own now, anyway.    ",4
"           Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal.  As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.

"       PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE talk to Rob and Gossett about prom THIS WEEK.  I'm serious.  Abby and I are going to be EXTREMELY mad if this doesn't work perfectly.  This is her night to be treated like a princess and I won't have you screwing it up.  Get the message to Rob and Gossett, that applies to Amber and me too.  Here's what you need to do:  1) Talk to Gossett and Rob about splitting a limo (remember this is April 17), and then book it.  We won't need a stretch probably, just one big enough to hold 6 people.  It needs to be at my house at 5:30.  Make sure the guys know that everyone is coming to my house beforehand, around 4:30 for people's parents to take pictures, etc.  Yall can just leave your cars here and then after prom the limo can bring us back and my mom will have a 'midnight breakfast' thing fixed.  The girls will spend the night and the guys will leave about 2:00 or whenever yalls parents want you home.  2) Make reservations at Carrabba's for six people at 6:00.  That will give us about an hour and 45 minutes to eat, so we can leave about 7:45 and have about 20 minutes to get to the factory so we can make a fashionably late entrance (we don't want to be the first ones there).  3) Remember (and remind Rob and Gossett) to order (wrist corsages for everyone is best) corsages at least a week in advance.  You will want to coordinate with your date's dress.  Abby's dress is hot pink, so you'll want to tell the florist that.  They're pretty good about helping you coordinate.  I'll try to get her to give you a swatch of the fabric to give to the florist.    4) Get measured for and order a tux ASAP (like, say, this weekend, since I KNOW you have nothing going on since it was going to be a DI weekend) because otherwise they'll be all gone and you'll be stuck.  Go with something pretty classic and you'll be safe.  Please please PLEASE don't dress really outrageously.  Now is not the time to be funny.  That's a great way to make Abby and her mother mad.    5) Relate all this info to Rob and Gossett.  And get ALL this done SOON.  If you wait any longer, there will be nothing available and then you will be left with three incredibly angry girls on their prom night.  It's not a pretty sight.  So please get everything done in the next week.    6)  If this stuff isn't done by the end of the month, I'm serious Josh, we are getting yall's parents on your case.  And don't print this out because it'll make me look like a real witch.      ",4

Seriously, though, I've often wondered what these guys are thinking as they go inside peoples' houses.  My daughter, still in her night clothes, answered the door, but fortunately, did not open it.  Our 5-month old puppy has a coniption fit ('good boy!').  My lovely wife and partner, who is faithfully doing laundry, reminded me that the light above our water meter is out.  So I came upstairs from blogging, and let Water-Meter Man in, amid the loudness of 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' (my hearing-impaired daughter does not have her hearing aids in).  I, bearing flashlight/radio/emergency siren/weather radio, let Water-Meter Man inside (I said that already), explaining to him that our light downstairs where the meter is doesn't work.  So I lead him downstairs, shine the light, he glances at the meter, enters something into his 'magical gadget', and heads back upstairs and out the door.  All this in less than one minute.  'Have a nice day,' I said, as he left our castle.  I quickly locked our door.  Afterward, I encouraged our daughter for coming to get us after opening the door to reveal 'Water-Meter Man', and I taught her to come get us whenever someone else comes to our door.  And 'normal' life resumed.  And that's all I have to say about that.         ",0
