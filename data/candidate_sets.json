I entered in  Khronos  into my WinMedia database and played some guitar, also took some time to listen to those wonderful satanic ballads. Then, our despair closed in as, despite a profuse and deep iced rain, they would not call us even and let us out.   So we were walking out the door when, for the fifth time that morning, we got a call. My grandmother had the guile to inform us that school was out. Preposterous, we said, we checked it just five minutes ago. LIAR. Although channel three was a black screen, and we assumed they were changing it so that, just secretly, we agreed with our grandmother that they really  did  close it. The first channel we came to said au contraire, still two hours late.   After much of this lollygagging, I just said, 'Turn it to channel three again,', where we were greeted with the much-loved 'Get the FUCK outta here!' sign/'School is closed for Wednesday, February 26, 2003' Powerpoint slide. That was enough for us.  I called my cousin, who was expecting us any minute and shouted the good news. He called back about two seconds later, shouting every blasphemy possible against the school system, with which I shouted all the ones he missed. Then Alex called and I put off the session, I suppose, at the very moment, as my mom wouldn't drive that far in the ice, despite how little ice it was. I went to Seth's to play the updated Counterstrike. We played that stuff alllllllll day, then we played Team Fortress and kicked ass/got our asses kicked on there. We cooked a pizza, and just as it was done, my mom called and says 'We're getting Nick and Jerry's (or some two names, it just really good pizza that you have to cook yourself, youse goys know what it is), you guys want some?' And Seth was preaching the goodness of those pizza persons, so we put the cooked pizza in the 'fridge and waited for mother. Then we had some of that pizza which was really good, and I went home.  So I go up to my room and started typing a George Washington Carver essay, I got it done for the most part, and I started reading. Then I felt more tired than I ever have in my life, I think. I put down the book and passed out for about three hours. When I woke up, I hear the phone ring about five times. I didn't even budge, I just pick'd up the book and went back to reading. I went downstairs later, where I heard dinner was being made; then I took control of the computer and here I am, typing this completely pointless essay on my life. I just wanted to type a bit. I'm probably just going to go back to sleep in a minute, I'm serious. I think I have lethargy disorder; it was brought to my attention as I noted my nap from yesterday.   So *yawn* all. And tons of scary shit this weekend.   It makes me hope we lose.    "

It is working pretty well...but hell, we all have setbacks sometimes, right?  Just tolerate me.  Hopefully this will be the last time I have to discuss the 'D' word on this site.  I'll reserve that for mine.  ~Z       "

Don't worry, it's no seizure! I was just inspired by Rob and the fact that everyday in third period, everyone but me is busting it out. So today I decided to break that trend and take the floor. Dancing is fun.  I hear there's dancing at the Progressive dinner?!?!? Dude. That would be killa. And I'll dance alone if Abby doesn't want to.

You think he'd learn after the thousandth time or so, 'maybe I should decrease that time a lil' bit'? Well, I dunno.  Drunks With Guns. I've only found one song called  Pavement ...it's a musical, and I must add, it's very drunken. As is most of their music. It turns out, Drunks With Guns began in 1984 as a punk band and spent more time making up the names of their songs that actually writing them. The music is incredibly worthless, it's the same throughout the entirety of the songs, so I've now heard, after hearing the very wonderful  Punched In The Head  and  some other songs with pretty offensive names ...just go look for them if you really want to know.   As with any punk band, they broke up from internal dissent and began a legal battle for possession of the name Drunks With Guns. So it is. But they are very drunk, let it be known right now.   True, I'm more of a Coke person. For a while I was a Pepsi person, I dunno what happened. I guess Coke got cheaper and I started buying that again. But Coke is like...the Jack Black of the carbonated beverage world, whereas Pepsi is more the Turning Leaf Chardonnay. Take the caffeine out of it and make it diet, tho, and it becomes Sewage In a Gold-Plated Can, Calorie Free. Gross. And whatever happened to Pepsi One? That stuff was horrible too, but I haven't seen it lately so I wondered...  Eep, I dunno about MSN but I don't like ICQ...I used it for about three days and then I was going to cry and do something dangerous with a sharp object to myself. But what's so evil about them from your standpoint?  Sigh. Days are really slow lately...has anyone noticed?  Something incredibly random: your skin actually cooks if it's thin enough and it touches a sunlight-heated car surface. My knuckle will bear testament, it was really sporadic and incredibly gross. But anyway...no more wasting electricity on the stove, no sir.   Goodnite friends, have a flower-filled, sunshining day.      "

      "1": "           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

And sorry to everyone else if I slighted you in any way, just hear me out first.  The day started out normally...sort of. I woke up after four hours of sleep, not being able to get back to that euphoric state of rest and feeling generally sluggish. I went and drank some really strong coffee. Then I took my Doryx, a face medicine. Without food, Doryx, in me, causes a chemical reaction that induces serious vomiting...that's why, when I was on my way to the movies to see XMen 2, I pulled over on the side of Ellington Parkway and vomited my guts out for the duration of fifteen minutes. Had I a simple cracker on hand I could have been safe. But no; I puked my guts out and sat down to breathe for another five or so. My dad pulled off (he took the driver's seat after this), and we had lunch with a friend at the Baja Burrito downtown, whereafter we saw X2, and it was wonderful. After it was over I got a call.  It was my mom. She said she had found my cat, not that he had been missing. It was that he was dead. I didn't really cry over it, but it got me to thinking about everything and it really seemed pointless. That's when I went to the library and, in those memory-filled surroundings, I composed that post. I haven't read it since, nor do I plan to.  I went home then. At home I sat around, I tried reading, I found my mind coming back to this post and the general reaction to it, I figured no one would really like it. I didn't care. My dad was watching TV, and he saw a commercial for Sonic.  'Let's go,' he said, 'see if we can get back before eight,' to WATCH A TV SHOW.   The drive was quick, dad was over the speed limit at least twelve miles an hour the whole time, but we made it. The order was quick, and we left just as quickly.  Coming down Ben Allen Road there is an intersect with the I-96 exits. A Lexus waited, wanting to make a left turn.  Dad was doing 50, 10 miles over the limit on Ben Allen.  The car rolled out too far and stopped in the right lane, My dad changed lanes.  The car rolled into the left lane, which we were presently in, and stopped.  I heard the breaks screeching, I saw it coming and gripped the sides of the car hard. I had enough time to scream, 'Oh shit.' Then it was chaos.  The initial punch of the airbags was loud. It shattered my side of the windshield into a million piees and my open, screaming mouth caught a few, which I would be coughing up for the duration of the night. The belt caught me hard on the shoulder and tore it a bit; I had a mild lasceration and a belt-shaped bruise over my chest. I did not touch the bag. My dad, on the other hand, caught him full in the face; he got a bit of a shiner and his shoulder is beaten up pretty bad. And I got covered in vanilla flavoured Coca-Cola.   I managed to reach over and turn off the car, I could smell the transmission about to start on fire, coupled with the excessive sulphurous smell of the bags freshly deflated. The first thing I did was get out of the car, scream 'FUCK!' to an audience of awe-struck people, and began kicking the car yelling the profanity until I remembered the lady in the gold Lexus, who was not getting out of her car.   Her leg was stuck and she had some diaphragm damage. The resultant ambulance and  five other emergency vechicles  were able to take care of her, not to mention the FIVE police men.   My dad's car was totaled, the Lexus had its axle bent in half, so the tire is like '/' that instead of '|' this.   There was a concrete island for one of the on-ramps, and I sat there, eating fries, reading Rosie's French dictionary, clutching my bleeding shoulder, and shaking my head as I looked up at the smoking wreck every few minutes. I read until the sun went down, and then I just stared at the wreck until they took it all away, I got into the back of a police cruiser, and we sped toward my house. The cop did  twenty over  until we got home. I got my mom to pick us up, I took two Benadryls, and I knew no more.  Jerry Cantrell once said 'Dying a little bit helps you appreciate life', and I really think it has.  Sorry all, and excuse me while I go spit up some more glass.      "

Ever find yourself lamenting, 'I missed it by that much!' when you don't reach a goal?  You think your plans are executed with precisions, and you avoid any covert obstacles that might be placed in your path, but you still come up short.  Your self-confidence wanes and you lose to the desire to make more goals.  Careful!  Chaos is right around the corner.  Be an agent of change and get SMART with your goals.  Here's the secret:   Specific:  Your goals should be clear and definite.  Measurable:  There should be a quantifiable standard against which to measure results.  Achievable:  Are your goals realistically doable with the time and resources available?  Relevant: Is what really matters most to you reflected in your goals?  Time-Dimensioned:  There should be clear and specific deadlines.  You'll be back in 'control' sooner than you know it.     ",

Last year he came by plane, but today he was on the bus tour, coming south from Michigan through Ohio.  The meeting was at   Hara Arena , which is just a couple minutes from where we live.  Jennie and I were leaving to head to an appointment south of town at the time the bus tour was heading from Hara.  Traffic was halted to make way for the entourage, which we were able to see.  Knowing that traffic toward I-75 southbound was going to be a mess, we decided to head through town.  Overhead we saw military helicopters.  All exit and entrance ramps to the Interstate were closed for a time.  I was late to my therapist appointment, but I was able to have it nevertheless.

      "1": "            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.

    "query_text": "       Oh no. They changed the format again. WHY? ARGH!  Anywayz dudez, it's really quiet over here and I'm lonely. Boo-freakin'-hoo. I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere.  To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by  THE VIDEO .  Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho.   So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great.  We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it.  At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend.   We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's  The Anthem  and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t.  And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old clich 'play with fire and you get burned'.  I  didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story.  Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail.   AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out.   We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets.   Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew.  And by the way...not any of that caused the burn.  The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so 'smile all' to quote Rosie.   And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters.  We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing  Master of Puppets  and  Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer.   Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter.  Peace.    ",

They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         ",

Learn to Cook  - there are cooking classes, cookbooks, and my personal favorite, the   food network  with all sorts of cooking shows like   Iron Chef ,   30 Minute Meals ,   Food 911 ,   Date Plate  , and   the Naked Chef with Jamie Oliver (why is it they pick the hunkiest hosts for these shows?  Cute men that can actually cook?  Woohoo!), you're bound to find something that appeals to your 'inner chef'!  2.   Exercise Your Body : you don't have to join a gym to get out and get some exercise!  Pick your favorite activity, or something that you've always wanted to learn, and get on a schedule, joing a group, or take a class to improve your skills.  3.   Exercise Your Mind : Learn something new, take a class, read a book, get certified, write your memoirs, anything is good as longs as it exercises your mind! 4.   Get Organized !

According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Next time Microsoft Corp. employees have problems with their laptop computers, they will have to call Hewlett-Packard Co.   The world's largest software maker announced on Monday that Hewlett-Packard had won a contract to run the help desk for its 61,000 employees and contractors worldwide. That could include advice on how to use advanced features of Microsoft's own software.   The companies said the multiyear deal was worth tens of millions of dollars but declined to be more specific.   HP already had a contract to run the help desk for about 11,000 Microsoft employees outside the United States. The expanded deal extends HP's reach to North America and envisions some overhaul and automation of its help system.   HP is the No. 1 seller of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, and it also is beefing up its services arm. Outsourcing deals, such as the one with Microsoft, are a key growth area.     http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/08/12/microsoft.hewlett.reut/index.html             ",

Been practicing the guitar, learning chords and strumming.  I'm going through a couple of books I got from the library.  Left fingertips are sore.  Been watching a lot of movies with the time off.

I need to do more offline journaling, especially my crime site ideas.  At night the imagination goes wild sometimes!  Christmas Eve we went to my aunt and uncle's in Cincinnati.  Ate dinner and saw some other relatives.  Spoke with a cousin who is in prison by phone.  Uncle took some digital pics of us and printed out copies for us to take back home.  Jennie worked on Christmas.  We opened presents in a rush, right before she went to work.  We left the wrapping all over the living room floor for a few hours so that we could just enjoy the presents and relax.  Keisha fell asleep on our bed yesterday.  It was a great idea because Jake and I took a nap too.  I also set up the bed frame -- our box spring and mattress have been on the floor since we moved in October.  Now our bed is higher.  I forgot about that this morning when I got out of bed and almost fell on the floor!  Jennie got me some silk pajamas and a silk robe.  The design makes me think of Austin Powers (yeah, baby, yeah!).  My wife is glad that I got my mojo on.  Also, she got me a shaving kit with gel, face wash, after shave, etc.  I took the hint and shaved off my beard and moustache last night.  We ate Christmas ham I'd gotten from work, with macaroni and cheese, brussel sprouts, beets, and candied yams.  I forsook the beets and yams in lieu of the brussel sprouts.  A beer to wash it all down was good, too.  I'll probably blog about Keisha's presents at another time: keyboard and kid karaoke machine.  How long do those batteries last?

In a somewhat technical discussion, the editorial examines why unemployment remains where it is, and indicates that there is a 'glimmer of hope for the jobless:' And here, at last, there is a glimmer of hope for the jobless. GDP growth may be accelerating and may move above 5 percent for the next two quarters. If it does, there will surely be a whole lot more jobs, especially in the labor-intensive service sector.   What's to be done? Not much, for now. No fiscal stimulus is possible, and the administration has already overdone its tax cuts. The only source of macroeconomic support will come from the Federal Reserve Board. It should keep short-term interest rates low and make sure rates for 10 years and longer don't spike any more. This, then, is the opinion of Mortimer B. Zuckerman.    ",

      "2": "           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         ",

One went to the window seat, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they conjugated, as still as the shadows of haystacks, while night went on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.  There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a lemurcapitulated far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the window seatchafed. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn mushroom gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.

As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         ",

The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war          ",

      "4": "                 Sorry Abby, you have to understand that yesterday was the conclusive bad day to the worst day ever. Let me tell you all about it. And sorry to everyone else if I slighted you in any way, just hear me out first.  The day started out normally...sort of. I woke up after four hours of sleep, not being able to get back to that euphoric state of rest and feeling generally sluggish. I went and drank some really strong coffee. Then I took my Doryx, a face medicine. Without food, Doryx, in me, causes a chemical reaction that induces serious vomiting...that's why, when I was on my way to the movies to see XMen 2, I pulled over on the side of Ellington Parkway and vomited my guts out for the duration of fifteen minutes. Had I a simple cracker on hand I could have been safe. But no; I puked my guts out and sat down to breathe for another five or so. My dad pulled off (he took the driver's seat after this), and we had lunch with a friend at the Baja Burrito downtown, whereafter we saw X2, and it was wonderful. After it was over I got a call.  It was my mom. She said she had found my cat, not that he had been missing. It was that he was dead. I didn't really cry over it, but it got me to thinking about everything and it really seemed pointless. That's when I went to the library and, in those memory-filled surroundings, I composed that post. I haven't read it since, nor do I plan to.  I went home then. At home I sat around, I tried reading, I found my mind coming back to this post and the general reaction to it, I figured no one would really like it. I didn't care. My dad was watching TV, and he saw a commercial for Sonic.  'Let's go,' he said, 'see if we can get back before eight,' to WATCH A TV SHOW.   The drive was quick, dad was over the speed limit at least twelve miles an hour the whole time, but we made it. The order was quick, and we left just as quickly.  Coming down Ben Allen Road there is an intersect with the I-96 exits. A Lexus waited, wanting to make a left turn.  Dad was doing 50, 10 miles over the limit on Ben Allen.  The car rolled out too far and stopped in the right lane, My dad changed lanes.  The car rolled into the left lane, which we were presently in, and stopped.  I heard the breaks screeching, I saw it coming and gripped the sides of the car hard. I had enough time to scream, 'Oh shit.' Then it was chaos.  The initial punch of the airbags was loud. It shattered my side of the windshield into a million piees and my open, screaming mouth caught a few, which I would be coughing up for the duration of the night. The belt caught me hard on the shoulder and tore it a bit; I had a mild lasceration and a belt-shaped bruise over my chest. I did not touch the bag. My dad, on the other hand, caught him full in the face; he got a bit of a shiner and his shoulder is beaten up pretty bad. And I got covered in vanilla flavoured Coca-Cola.   I managed to reach over and turn off the car, I could smell the transmission about to start on fire, coupled with the excessive sulphurous smell of the bags freshly deflated. The first thing I did was get out of the car, scream 'FUCK!' to an audience of awe-struck people, and began kicking the car yelling the profanity until I remembered the lady in the gold Lexus, who was not getting out of her car.   Her leg was stuck and she had some diaphragm damage. The resultant ambulance and  five other emergency vechicles  were able to take care of her, not to mention the FIVE police men.   My dad's car was totaled, the Lexus had its axle bent in half, so the tire is like '/' that instead of '|' this.   There was a concrete island for one of the on-ramps, and I sat there, eating fries, reading Rosie's French dictionary, clutching my bleeding shoulder, and shaking my head as I looked up at the smoking wreck every few minutes. I read until the sun went down, and then I just stared at the wreck until they took it all away, I got into the back of a police cruiser, and we sped toward my house. The cop did  twenty over  until we got home. I got my mom to pick us up, I took two Benadryls, and I knew no more.  Jerry Cantrell once said 'Dying a little bit helps you appreciate life', and I really think it has.  Sorry all, and excuse me while I go spit up some more glass.      "

You know, your Emotional Bank Accounts -- the trust you have built up in your different relationships.  Still waiting for a 'statement' to arrive?  Here's one:  If you don't know, you're probably overdrawn!  Maintaining a reserve of trust in relationships requires constant investing.  Consider this advice:   Bad checks .  What you consider to be a deposit (like going to the movies when your date wants to talk) may actually be a withdrawal for others.  They can't collect on your efforts because it does not meet their actual needs.  Really understanding others is key to building trust.  Pocket change . Showing respect, kindness, and courtesy may seem like small deposits, but over time they compound and increase your reserve.  Neglecting the little things will soon have you in the red.  Count on me .  Breaking commitments or promises often can bankrupt you.  Keeping them is the best way to save for a rainy day in any relationship. Rich relationships -- what a great payoff!    ",

But I also agree that it's a social, not political issue.  Mississippi & Alabama really are almost different worlds from what goes on closer to the Mason-Dixon.  I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.

Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         ",

I swear...no one being on anymore...it's like living in the grey halls of the dead.  Well, summer is off to a fantastic start. First, I got my license which I can't use, because of not having a car. Having it is totally amazing, nonetheless, it's like opening a Pandora's Box with not so much of the after-effect; moreover, it just satiates that taste of freedom.  Ignorance  is coming along quite well...we've got to complete this eight song demo pretty damned quick here; the clock is ticking. So fars, as to the demo, that is... A Bleeding Year ,  Broken Me ,  Close My Eyes ,  Little Rhyme ,  My Solution ,  Goodbye My Friend ...one that's almost finished but not quite,  Consanguinity (u BLE*2D lyk me) ...that's about all, but I've been processing another in my head all day, so number eight should be on it's way out pretty soon. Totally excited, but that basically means I move away from Brentwood for...the rest of my life, pretty much. We've got time between tours and stuff like that, but it'll probably be spent in hotels a thousand miles away...it's just the way these things work.   It's kind of upsetting, thinking of all of this in its element: Rosie made the slightly misspelled point the other day that in two years, this dream ends, and it's time to wake up or go back to sleep again, and start a different dream. Either way, it means never coming back to this safe little haven of ours here. And to think that this album might just be done before the end of this summer, and with the slight likelihood that it takes off...I'll never come back. I've never been too far out of Brentwood, at least not for long. But this is a permanent ex-communication, even if I did come back. It's like having a friend in the hospital for a few years...the next time you see them again, you treat them differently, like they would break. You try to tell yourself that they're just the same as before, but they're not, and neither are you.   So in the rare event that this did happen, that would be the end of me, it would be the same me but one who is sort of...gone...it's the same face and the same words and probably the same personality if not a bit more optimistic...but it's still not me. It scares me to death, but it's the same reason that I draw air every second of my present existence.  Because summer doesn't give me much to hope for. The things I do anticipate are either a bit riddled with worries and over-concern, or too far off to care about overly at present. Tho it sounds pretty dark it's just the way it is...if you saw me during one of my days, that's just the way it goes. Self-imposed isolation? Perhaps. Depression? Give it that name if you will. Honestly, this is the most socialization I've done out of any summer this far in my life, and it's only the beginning.  That reminds me of another thing I was thinking of...the fact that I'm only sixteen.  It's a trademark of being American, to be sixteen. It means responsibility, it means coming of age. But the fact is, it also means that the years are shrinking and running out...  Did anyone notice how fast this year has gone?  Yesterday, I was outside doing something or another, and I happened to think back on every year of my life. I put little tags of each of them, I've found. This is the year that I was happy and the world was no bigger than my living room, this is the year that was the first time I decided to become a creature of depression and death, and this year was the second time that that happened, this was the week in that year where I fucked everything up, and this is the other week that everything fucked me up and just hasn't stopped yet. Stuff like that, I tag them.  But the thing is, I'm already tired of putting tags on the years, remembering all of this is getting old...and I'm only sixteen. I'm thinking ahead to forty, what happens then? Will I just remember that I've been alive this long, not that when I was sixteen I thought I had a new beginning but instead just had to go back and finish the old ones, but that I was a kid. It bores me to tag all of these years and remember them, but at the same time it burns me to think that, in the end, I'm just a bundle of thoughts and visions that even I can't piece together, that in the end, I am simply nothing more than a little piece of everyone's puzzle, and that everyone's puzzle burns out in the end as well.   I don't even know if I actually  want  to remember some thing that have happened, which is why I won't write any of this down, and which is also why there's a certain gladness to the gallery of these years floating me away to the nexus at the end.   Well, that's about all. And everyone knows, me especially, that there's a lot of things that I could talk about and make a huge post about, that I am not, for decency's sake...but just remember that I  am  thinking about these things, and that there really are people behind these words, not just robots that interact with the bullshit we put up here.  Ben Folds said it best in this song I'm supposed to be playing at Abby's party...and it's a really good song, this  Still Fighting It , but anyway, the lines that struck me most are...'Everybody knows: it hurts/sucks to grow up'.   It's striking irony, and it's beautiful teenage poetry.     "

My maternal grandmother's name was Loraine, but we thought - especially after consulting my wife - that Keisha Loraine was not a good idea -  punny , but not the best choice (Ever heard of Quiche Lorraine?).  Actually, the name Keisha Renee just came to me one day.  It sounded beautiful.  Some time after she was born I looked both names up in a baby name book.  'Keisha' is derived from the same African-American word that means 'newly created.'  'Renee' is French for 'reborn.'  Hence, we've considered her name an inspiration from God: She was our 'newly-created' child, and our desire is for her, when she gets old enough to make the decision to follow God for the rest of her life, that she will be 'reborn.'  God has not yet allowed us to have any more children, but if we could have a son, we would name him Caleb William.  We like 'Caleb' because it means 'faithful,' after   the man in the Old Testament with the same name .  William was my father-in-law's name.           ",

It seems sort of pointless having this brawl on Saturday: all that's going to happen is they're going to rip each other's heads off for five hours, whilst I sit back and eat Abby's wonderful cupcakes with sprinkles, just for me :) : the point is, there isn't a damn thing we can say that will change any opinions here, life isn't like the movies, and this isn't going to work itself out peacefully, since history does repeat itself, and history has been a cold-hearted vagrant thus far.  I don't know how this happened, but it's really a terrible shame. After all, having a friend is knowing someone's faults and overlooking them, simply because you call them friend. Alex has been one of my best friends for years. We constantly knock the shit out of each other, call each other faggots, Alex is too conceited and he thinks I'm too melodramatic; and truly, we're both right. But instead of capitalizing on the fact that we're not the best humans in the world, we use it to our advantages and just laugh at ourselves for all the stupid stuff we've done; we laugh at other people; and in the end, whether there are problems with one another, we really don't fucking care, because Alex is my  friend , come hell or high water.  So here's my take on it: no one's going to give any ground for this, and if any ground is given, it will only be temporary: one will find something wrong that the other has done, it will resurrect all these long dead demons, etc.; also, the parties involved are too emotional about this whole deal, it's been  way  blown out of proportion, and we're arguing about the wrong things. And moreover, and yes, I realize I've already said this,  NO ONE INVOLVED IS GOING TO REALLY LISTEN TO ANYONE ELSE .   Was anyone really looking for the good way out of this? It could have ended if the parties involved weren't so stubborn, it could have ended long ago, and it might have had a better ending. If everyone else actually truly believes we can get somewhere out of this soon-to-be debacle at Abby's, then I'm all for you, and I'll be at the front row just like the rest of you, catching the teeth as the competition batters each other to no living end, I'll be there until we taste their tears and make the anger our own and totally lose it and never speak to one another again, just because a little spat turned into a never-ending feud, everyone allies with everyone else, and there is no 'circle' anymore, it's just loose confederacies as we all try to get the others to see it our way.  But if anyone can see at all what a bad idea this is to carry on with number three, then please back me up, because I'm sure no one can honestly envision any good end coming to a head at the end of that day. Look where all of our good intentions have landed us in this situation this far.      "

As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          ",

C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          ",

TWO NEW SONGS! Of course,  Little Rhyme  has been done forever, but in my room on recording day I wrote the chorus; the words in the verses have never been changed, though. The other song is  Let Me Go (The Tip of My Tongue) ...this song is just violent. I wrote it last night and in about three hours when my dad decides to wake up, I'm going to go upstairs, lock myself in my room, and record it until I die, or finish. This is going to be hard, for what I have in mind.  But, as tradition, the lyrics:   Little Rhyme  by Stranglebox  Father father, where'd you go Calling out to no one Empty, sullen, all alone Mercy to my mission Brother brother, moaning low Living ruination Crying crying, time is slow Sleep in devastation  CHORUS So I pray you'll be alright Cuz all my other prayers have died And I hope you'll turn out right Cuz you've been otherwise denied Now I say my little rhyme Little comfort passing time And you had every right to lie And so for that I'll say goodbye  Mother mother, no one knows Just how deep this chasm Sunder, plunder, I did so I produced this spasm Sister sister, I'd forego Anything to save me Killed it, killed it, bloody clothes Falsity depraves me  CHORUS SOLO CHORUSx2  See, these songs aren't too complicated, and that's what makes them beautiful. Next one...this song was originally intended to be a 'rhythm singing' song, and has existed in some form or another for a week or so now, but it's turned into actual singing now, it's kind of eerie considering the rest of the song is screaming and such, and I mean  real  screaming this time, none of that  My Solution  sing-screaming stuff, full-out RC schtick.   Let Me Go (The Tip of My Tongue)  by Stranglebox  CHORUS Everything I see reminds me of you Every lie you paint a picture untrue Everything I've loved has bled me right through And no matter what I do you just won't (let me go) The cap on the jar of my pain is unscrewed Now there's nothing left in me I could do I used to be the one but I'm split in two And no matter what I do you just won't (let me go)  Condescention, never mention Everything left is lies and pretentions What I was and what I will be Doesn't really matter cuz it never was me I Sit back and wear the mask And never really take my turn When it comes to the fact I'm loathe to react Just wanna sit back and watch it burn  CHORUS  Verbal violence, that or silence Negative sentiment that day and since Used t be the bleeder and I took the whip But I found the gun so I shoot from the hip I Take out the time to crawl back inside And hide within myself Tiptoe on the faultline before it snaps And opens straight to my little hell  CHORUS  You've got a long way You're still so young But I've grown beyond my years With many songs been sung I wait and never relate The everything I've done But even with your hand on my mouth I can shout Cuz I've got you And the words on the tip of my tongue  LET ME GO x 8  CHORUS  LET ME GO x4 GO x 5  Angry angry angry! Whee! The 'still so young' part is the calm before the storm, and then we bust it out and kill someone with the LET ME GOs; the drums are going to get really fast and the guitar is going to bottom out and sound like shit, which is just what any little metal junkie is looking for.

Perhaps we have cause for misgiving, but that's no reason not to have a bit of trust.  My mom made a point the other day, that when someone breaks your trust, it's damn near impossible to get it all back. I dunno if I like the idea but it seems fairly reasonable on some level. Like, they may seem to get it all back, but you'll still be subconciously looking over your shoulder.   Unprovable, yes, very pessimistic, also a yes. True? I think so, as sad as that is. Trust is one of those things people look for to survive. If someone has stabbed you in the back before, what's to stop them from doing it again? Circumstance, yes. But should there ever be a great reason for us, doing no wrong, to be betrayed by those we trust in?  Rhetorical questions are awesome, but they haven't been effective since 'give me liberty...'. I think people have just become too smart for that kind of persuasion. Or too stubborn to think, rather. In any event:    This is the end of the post      "

I could not stay another day, to laugh, to love, to work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way; I found that place at the close of day.  If my parting has left a void, then fill it with remembered joy.  A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss; Ah yes, these things, I too, will miss.  Be not burdened with times of sorrow; I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. My life's been full, I savored much; Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.  Perhaps my time seemed all too brief; Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me; God wanted me now.  He set me free.   I do not know who wrote the poem above.

Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         ",

I got pissed off so I wrote this song There's no new words so sing along Can you say 'fuck'? Can you scream real loud? Cuz if you can do that, then you know just how Grandma's in the kitchen makin' s'ghetti and meatballs A little Taiwanese kid just learned how to fly And everybody's story is a story to beat all So here comes the chorus, and you can't beat mine  Half-past the cynical, borderline sarcastic Welcome to the chorus where it all comes back Maybe feign political, really self-slapstick This doesn't make sense, but you already knew that  So here goes the part where I first say 'fuck' But if you've already heard us, then fuck stuff I don't have another Top 40 coming up any time And it's by the grace of God that I can even still rhyme Every motherfucker hearing 'fuck', and going crazy I bet you'd fucking like it if I yelled some fucking more This might be the fucking greatest you've heard maybe But all I fuckin' know's, it's making my throat sore   Chorus   The End! And another. Ok, so the song is called  Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue) , but it isn't about sniffing glue...even tho it actually comes out and says that. It's more about wanting to be killed and stay a kid than to grow up and be everyone's bitch, and glue is the proposed remedy.   When last I checked, 'fuck' was used very interestingly in this song, and without frugality. It's another pop-punk song, hence the excessive use of 'fuck' and other four-letters. So lessgo!! w00tw00t!!!111oneone   Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue)  by Stranglebox  You tell me I am gonna be A really big star if I can be A superman, everything and more Than I am All society has pressured me To go and take a stand Where I cannot I make a lot of mistakes And more than half the time I'm on a repeat anyways I'm not gonna learn a stupid motherfucking thing So would you please shut the fuck up And go the fuck away  You have told me a thousand times But I never really seem to change I haven't got a reason or rhyme Cuz all I fucking feel is shame So let's cut the bullshit and get to the heart And that way we can find a real place to start Yeah, I don't really know about a thing you do Cuz all's I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (Hooah!!)  You talk about how great I am When I'm watching it So would you understand when I Say that I can't take anymore The teams ain't fucking fair And I'm the one with the losing score Gonna kill me a bunch 'o braincells Cuz all the bullshit that was simple's On a downslide to hell It's ok if I am only talking about  Fucking up, but when I do it Then it's time to throw me out   Chorus  Lude  Chorus  Yeah, I don't really know But hell if anybody knew Cuz all I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (YEEAAAAH!!!)  That stuff after the chorus in parenthesis is really in the song, it's a great one!!! This is the ultimate 'Fuck conformity!!!' Anthem right here.

With such titles as  Norm Bakerton the Monkey Shit Shoveller ,  Cacophony ,  Churn ,  Grave  (which is actually going on the demo once we get it all down pat.....IF we do), and... Slump . I might as well.  It might take some thinking to figure out the last line of the chorus...sort of open to interpretation, but I'm sure you all could get something out of it.   Slump  by Stranglebox  I woke up early Saturday morning smelled like rain and Feeling blown and surly I thought tomorrow would hurt like hell I hope that I'm not right.....as I open my eyes  I took my time I drank a Coke and swallowed memories I lost the rhyme The reason soon thereafter followed I sink into a wall.....you're up, but nature says you fall  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use some new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  I waited outside Cold as hell the street was frozen I smiled as it shined And knew how quick it'd kill me If I gave it one quick try.....cuz it only lives to die  The drive was cold, it was 6 PM, December 21 And ten more days, I know Will be a new year, this has been The worst one of my life.....it sucks, but it burns to go outside  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  (little 'lude)  Oh it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the tiem, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all (repeat)  I've become a really odd songwriter lately. I don't write in any given time period (granted,  Slump ), I just write a whole lot of really really bipolar stuff. Sigh...sometimes it sucks to be on the craaazy side of the lefty fence.  And by the way...Jsoh? Can that even be pronounced?    "

But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.

The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?   New Tax Plan May Bring Shift In Burden  Poor Could Pay A Bigger Share     By Jonathan Weisman Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, December 16, 2002; Page A03    As the Bush administration draws up plans to simplify the tax system, it is also refining arguments for why it may be necessary to shift more of the tax load onto lower-income workers.  Economists at the Treasury Department are drafting new ways to calculate the distribution of tax burdens among different income classes, which are expected to highlight what administration officials see as a rising tax burden on the rich and a declining burden on the poor. The White House Council of Economic Advisers is also preparing a report detailing the concentration of the tax burden on the affluent and highlighting problems with the way tax burdens are calculated for the poor.  The efforts would thrust the administration into a debate that until now has lingered on the fringes of economic policy: Are too few wealthy Americans paying too much in taxes for too many, and should the working poor and middle class be shouldering more of the tax burden?  'The increasing reliance on taxing higher-income households and targeted social preferences at lower incomes stands in the way of moving to a simpler, flatter tax system,' R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, warned at a tax forum at the American Enterprise Institute on Tuesday.  The Council of Economic Advisers' 'Economic Report to the President,' scheduled for release late next month or in early February, is to include a section arguing for new methods to calculate the distribution of tax burdens on various income groups.   The Treasury Department is working up more sophisticated distribution tables that are expected to make the poor appear to be paying less in taxes and the rich to be paying more.  Answering critics who say the working poor do face high taxes because they pay high Social Security payroll taxes, outgoing White House economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey told the AEI tax forum that the 12.4 percent Social Security levy should not be considered when tax burdens are calculated. Lindsey said the Social Security tax is ultimately returned to the taxpayer as a benefit.   Lindsey compared the Social Security tax to a deposit in a neighborhood bank's Christmas Club. In such clubs, periodic deposits are returned in a lump sum during the holiday season, and Lindsey said no one would consider such deposits a tax.  Early this month, J.T. Young, the deputy assistant treasury secretary for legislative affairs, lamented in a Washington Times opinion article: '[Higher] earners cannot produce the level of revenues needed to sustain the liberals' increasingly costly spending programs over the long-term. . . . If federal government spending is not controlled, then the tax burden will have to begin extending backward down the income ladder.'  The tenor of the administration's policy discussions marks a dramatic shift from early in 2001, when Bush sold his 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut as a tool to 'take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class,' emphasizing its beneficial impact on workers 'on the outskirts of poverty.' At that time, the administration fretted over the tax burden on the working poor, which the White House calculated to include federal income taxes, state taxes and the Social Security tax.  When administration officials pushed the need to create private investment accounts to supplement Social Security, they specifically warned that taxes paid into Social Security would not necessarily be returned unless the system was reformed.  William W. Beach, an economist at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said he was sympathetic to Lindsey's argument that the Social Security tax is not really a tax. But, he said, it was a dangerous argument for a Republican to make.  'Do I allow defense spending to offset my income taxes since I like to be defended? Do I allow road taxes to offset my profits taxes because I use the roads?' he asked. 'If you do start down that road, it's hard to see anything as taxes.'  But for the purposes of a tax reform debate, removing Social Security taxes from consideration could have a sizable impact. The top 5 percent of the nation's taxpayers paid 41 percent of all federal taxes, a hefty share, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But that same group paid from 56 to 59 percent of all income taxes, an even more impressive burden.  'If we take out Social Security, the poor will look very lightly taxed,' said Robert S. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group backed by organized labor.  Democrats say the shift could prove ominous for lower-income Americans. And they appear eager for the fight.  'These people are setting the tone in saying the poor really are not being taxed enough and that the burden is too high on the rich,' said New York Rep. Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. 'We're going back some 70 years.'  Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Calif.), a member of the committee, said: 'I don't think there's any question you have a number of extremists in the Republican ranks that would like to see the wealthy do very well. They're going to try to make the case that the average American is overtaxed and subsidizing the poor.'  But to some conservatives, the shift is long overdue. Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has argued for two years that the nation is entering a dangerous period in which the burden of financing government is falling on too few people. In such an environment, the masses will always vote for politicians promising ever-more-generous social programs, knowing they will not have to pay for such programs, DeMint warned.  'This issue is coming to a head,' DeMint said earlier this month, just minutes after making his pitch to outgoing Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 'You can't maintain a democracy if the people who are voting don't care what their government costs.'  DeMint and his allies have called for a national sales tax to replace the income tax. For those below the federal poverty line, sales taxes paid would be refunded, but under the system, at least they will have seen the cost of government, he said. The working poor would accept a higher tax burden because they would be relieved of the need to file a tax return.  DeMint called his ideas 'the duck's feet under the water,' propelling his proposals forward invisibly. Conservative thinkers at the Heritage Foundation and other think tanks have begun expressing similar opinions. Last month, the Wall Street Journal editorial page made waves with an article titled, 'The Non-Taxpaying Class.'  'Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else,' the editorial stated. 'They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.'  But advocates of this new line can expect a furious backlash. Liberal commentators have already reduced the argument to an appeal to tax the poor, and even conservatives worry that the label will stick.  'It's hard to conclude it's anything else,' said the Heritage Foundation's Beach.  Michael J. Graetz, a Yale University law professor and tax reform expert, said he could not figure out where the administration's arguments are supposed to lead.  'I would be very surprised if the agenda is to put more people on the tax rolls,' he said. 'That doesn't seem like a good political agenda.'  But Democrats say that is exactly where the administration is heading. Matsui said he sees the seeds of a disastrous Republican overreach.  'The president is making the case that people who earn between $50 [thousand] and $75,000 a year should be paying a third more taxes,' Matsui said. 'I'd love to debate him on that.'  But McIntyre worried that in the marketplace of ideas, the new argument could carry the day.  'I would hope the public would find it repugnant,' he said, 'but I suppose you never know.'           ",

There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  ",

Nancy Reagan to Bush: 'We Don't Support Your Re-Election'    The widow of former President, and Republican icon, Ronald Reagan has told the GOP she wants nothing to do with their upcoming national convention or the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article   here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs.  On the other hand, if you only take care of the goose with no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won't have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the goose.

I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).

Allowing the inspectors more time to search Iraq would have lead to a peaceful conclusion. 3. Leaving Saddam Hussein in power is better for the Iraqi people than giving them a shot at self-governance (with the very real possibility of chaos and failure to create a viable government).

It looks like a zombie-thing, it's badass.  And I haven't made a long post in a while, so I felt compelled to do so. Let's begin.  Familial problems springing up again. It's hard to explain where they're all coming from. You think you have a feeling beat, but it decides to reincarnate and spring up on you. If I hear one more thing about Jennifer I'm going to kill myself.  School's ok. I passed US History, I can't complain. Barely, mind. But I frick'n did. The test damn near gave me a seizure at first sight, but it was alright, as well.  I had fun last night on a treadmill, and about made my heart explode. I even fell off at one point, I don't think anyone saw tho, except my mom who was right next to me. And I was simultaneously watching something really smutty on VH1, but I couldn't hear it since my headphones weren't working. It appeared very smutty.  But I kicked the crap out of a punching bag while I was there. And had fun with a medicine ball. My mother made me sterile with said ball, which wasn't too thrilling...she overthrew just a bit. At least I made a funny deflating noise as I was unusually castrated.  Altho today I was reminded of the little plastic baby I had to take home in 8th grade. You know...the ones that cry and you put the keys in their backs, et cetera...and I was forced to wonder if maybe it was a gift that I was rendered incapable of reproduction. But no. It didn't happen, nor do I hate children or not want a family someday.  My hair is annoying. I've been thinking about getting it cut a lot lately, but knowing that I won't. I just wish the bangs would grow a bit more so that 1. I wouldn't have to trim it to mullet length for a while so as to get bangs, and 2. so that I could have a ponytail, so that conversations and consuming wouldn't consisting of me spitting out hair every three seconds.  Yesterday was the 25 year anniversary of Pope John Paul II. THE POPE!!! In Stout's class today, someone wrote, 'The Pope is Dope!' on the board, and Julian stapled a sign on her message board that reads, 'Got Pope?' I have one of those signs, it's going in my room somewhere. I feel bad for John Paul...he's probably the last of the fully pious left, and he's about to buy the farm.   To the best of us...  I've been trapped in my room lately. Mom's on the phone all the time (a serious hinderance to Abby Time, by the way), and Kate's always on the computer until really late, so I never get to use it anymore. Not til the weekends, like right now.  So that pretty much means I sit in my room and think my insane thoughts and go crazy. Man, the last couple 'o weeks have been frickin' distorted. Seriously. I even scared myself with the writings that have come out of me lately.  Like, my mom actually came out and confronted me with being anorexic...that was some shit. I was going, 'No...' But it would be just like me tho, wouldn't it? This is my struggle-free year, but this year I get to set myself up for the fall next year, plummeting into the depths of anorexia and madness. Yeh, let's hope not. A lot. I'm really not too keen on dying at the moment.  O well. I think I had more, but I thought about it too much, and have thusly forgotten it. I've been thinking of doing a gargantuan post all day, but this is the best I could do. Too tired. Too many dreams and 'old man moments', where I wake up way early for no reason, and stare at the ceiling and think of random stuff til the alarm goes off.  O well again. Irrelevently yours.

But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.

The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.

Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?  Should one not discard it out the window of a car?  Should one not draw on it?  What if I draw on a painting of a flag?  Is a painting a flag?  Or is it only cloth?  Does plastic count?  Does it have to be a rectangle?  What of flag bookmarks?  Flag shot glasses?  Flag shirts, socks, hats?  What if I am angered by the discovery of something horrible that my country sanctioned, and I want to remove the flag sticker from my car -- should I wait until I've calmed down, so the act of disposing of the flag sticker won't be soiled by my mood at the time?  Here's a quandary:  All the people protesting in Great Britain today are encouraging those who committed the latest bombings in Turkey.  *Even* if they honestly don't think they're doing so!  Conundrum Corner indeed!  yelahneb:  If Iraqis feel that they can bicker amongst themselves, but if someone tells them what to do, they want none of it.  In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.  What do we do *now*?  -- Nonaffiliated But Engaged in Virginia         ",

She received something in an email from another friend of ours, and what it contained seemed to disturb her.   Written communication can be difficult to understand.  Since I read words that have already been spoken, I only have that evidence to go on in order to understand the writer's message.  More exists than simply the written text.  As a reader, I must consider the following:    What is the main theme? What are the main points? What is the writer's tone? What can I get from the author's choice of words? What about the writer's style? What bias do I bring as I read? What is the mood of the piece? What mood do I bring as I read? If I know the writer, how is my relationship with him/her?    I propose that with what an author writes, he or she has put forth a challenge to potential readers:   Understand what I'm writing.    While some may consider that idea obvious, I believe it is important to examine more than simply the text an author has given us.  To truly understand an author's message, therefore, we must take an active role as we read.         ",

Here's one:  If you don't know, you're probably overdrawn!  Maintaining a reserve of trust in relationships requires constant investing.  Consider this advice:   Bad checks .  What you consider to be a deposit (like going to the movies when your date wants to talk) may actually be a withdrawal for others.  They can't collect on your efforts because it does not meet their actual needs.  Really understanding others is key to building trust.  Pocket change . Showing respect, kindness, and courtesy may seem like small deposits, but over time they compound and increase your reserve.  Neglecting the little things will soon have you in the red.

Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.  If the resources are available, and the public agrees on the necessary trade-offs, perhaps one day it will come to pass.         ",

Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         ",

There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the window seat shuddered.  'Open in the name of the Meer!' said a voice thin and foreboding.

I have to put in a form on Monday to get it changed, and I hope that's all I have to do. It'll be mighty embarrasing coming into the class with no paper, mumbling about switching out. Crying.  I mightily pwned at CS tonite. I really pissed off Brooks, too. He wanted me to turn off the gravity, and most times people will assert their dominance on the game by telling you to do something, then killing you a couple of times until you do it, or you kick them off of your game. Well, in Brooks's case, I kept killing him and he kept telling me to stop, and I didn't, of course. So then he started insults, and I did some back, and Brooks found out I'm a lot better than him at it. So the worst he could do was call Alex and cry about it, whereafter Alex came back with the same nonchalant news of 'Brooks doesn't want to play with you anymore'. O, STILL, MY HEART. But really...people get so damn touchy...not about the game, about other people. It's like we can't even respect the fact that some people are new to the game, and sometimes things, like in real life, just aren't fair. That some people are better than others, things like that...yes, I even blame myself in this category. I still blame people as 'hacking' when they're doing too good...but honestly, I'm right a lot of times...it's hard to miss h4x4ur$ easily.  I'm starting to sound like that damn book, Catcher in the Rye. Wow, somebody help me...I'm not kidding.  Anyway...I went to Seth's house today, he had a prelim vid of Shitfiend...two, actually. He had one called 'THE BAND' that was of us and Alex playing  Freedom ,  Master of Puppets  (mostly), and  Santa's Coming , the CKY version. AND he put part that Chingy song that I think is so godly in there. Chingy is the greatest rapper, right next to 50 Cent. LOL J/K A-HOLZ.   And the other video was called  FIRE ...all of our fire stunts. Yes, that includes me getting my ass blown off my body, a couple of times, and Seth lighting himself on fire, and me filming fire really close up, and us throwing basketballs at Alex while he rides through a flame downhill on a scooter. And other stuff. And  Welcome to the Jungle  is playing in the background. It looks so amazing...the best part is, he says he didn't use hardly  any  of the footage. We have enough right now to put into a full-length vid, but it would be boring. So we're going to stretch it out a bit...shopping cart tryx in winter, fun with leaves and Halloween and skits about 'Nam in the backyard right now. More car stuff, more band stuff, more Chingy. More pool stuff if we can fit it all in. And some of us will probably have nicknames. Like, in the credits of the first cut of the video, Seth refers to me as 'assrocket'. That's like Art Webb 1986 or Raab Himself for those that follow CKY/Jackass.   I'm eating like a horse these days. I went to this little hole in the wall BBQ joint for dinner...it was pretty durned good. I had a cheeseburger and fries, the best fries I've had in my life, and my dad had a half-side of ribs (that a helluva lot) and okra and baked beans. And so we sat there and talked up a storm with the owners while they cooked our stuff, and they kicked out some homeless guy for the 'thousandth time today', and some guy said he thought he knew me but he didn't. The place was called 'Justine's Southern BBQ', and there's a teenage girl there named Justine...hence. It'll probably be sold and bought in a few months, it always is, but check it out, it's always some kind of grill joint or another. That was the first time in my life I've eaten there, it was ass-kick.  Well, crack a grin all, this may be the last one you get 'til hell lets out again.   Until such time as we meet, adieu.    "

Well, even with an incomplete set and a song still 20 seconds overtime,  Stranglebox  is going to try out for the talent show.

We're doing  the  practice this weekend, lasting from Friday to the end of Saturday, taking the Playstation 2 out of the practice room and locking the door, taking five minutes for a break every hour. And if all goes to plan, that should be a good twelve hours at least. I hope we don't crack under the pressure. We have to teach Tyler the part before Friday, and somehow cut 20 more seconds before the tryouts. Monday, Monday, Monday.  Today was the  day  of days. Mostly, it started in fifth when I was getting beaten up everywhere, the world was a flurry of blows and shouts of tumultuous laughter. It ended when I fell back into a wall and ripped one of Mr. Adams's posters a bit, with many a witness. Before this, there was a test in the class which I am nearly positive that I did horribly on, plus the fact that I didn't do the homework, sacrificing that for the last few months of lost sleep. But that was the start of it. After this came sixth period, where I found a bit too late of a quiz in the class, but knew for the most part. Moreover, I was becoming tired, and now I have forgotten most of what was said, a summary of a quiz for tomorrow's sixth period.  In seventh, we had yet  another  quiz I did not study for, only failing to pull an answer for two, one of which was left blank, the other, a drastic, last minute guess, and both answers of which I was unable to find in the book. Then I remember the book test on this book, which is  Monday , same as the talent show tryouts, and a report on plants  Tuesday , both of which I have failed to start on. And here I am making a BLog post, and after this, I'm going to bed. Surprise that my laziness statistic is going through the roof.  Then, I got to my lessons, where I was waiting outside for the wrong class, I had switched the times of the two and forgotten, much to my chagrin. So I got a shortened lesson on both of them, and did horribly on both of them. But somehow, not in an entirely terrible mood. It was, environmentally, a bad day. My skin jacket, affected, the box called soul, not. A wonderful day, in that respect.  I know tomorrow will be better, the days after always are. That was one out of the past four. And I always get one out of every week as a 'bad day', at least one. Plus, I've been wishing on the clock for the past four days at 11:11 for good luck, and although it never does anything, I can always run into some unsuspectingly good luck and attribute it to this clock wishing.  And no philosophic posts tonight, at least for now.  I  know  you're all  so  depressed.    "

      "0": "              Prayer Request   Last week, I received another email from my good friend and sister in Christ, Dana B.  She writes: I have a personal prayer request for everyone.  As most people know I have two girls: Hailie is 6 years old and Stevie is 4 years old.  Well, Hailie had been complaining of lower back pain, so we went to the family doctor who requested an X-ray.  It came back showing what looked like a hairline fracture so we were sent to an orthopedic doctor.    [The orthopedic doctor] looked at the X-ray and agreed he saw something but was not 100% sure, so she had a bone scan done about two weeks ago.  She had her follow up appointment yesterday.  My prayer was answered that it was not cancer or a tumor.  But we were told she has a condition called 'Spondylolysis,' and basically that means that on her lumbar 5 vertebra, she has a crack where it looks like the fork (I do not know how to totally explain it).    Usually this happens to children that are older and are more athletic.  So they are thinking she was born with it.  But the specialist will be monitoring her to see if it will heal.  If it does not heal, they will try these steps in order:  Physical therapy, Back brace, and last would be Surgery.   Basically what can happen is if it does not heal, the crack can totally break and there would be a shift in that vertebra, and that would cause the nerves to be exposed.  I am understanding this is not a totally crisis condition but I am requesting your prayers that the situation can be stablized and that no more damage will be done.    It is hard to understand that a 6 year old is dealling with this.  If she can have back pain at 6, how will this effect her later in life?  I guess I should not worry about this.  God is already in control and knows the outcome already.  I am at peace with that.  Well, thanks for taking a moment to read about my prayer request.  I love you all.

      "3": "           Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.         ",

Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to 'hold out' (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!  And then to top it off, I managed to arrange for a sitter for Katherine on Sunday (RTG), and Ben has the audacity of stopping at a stop sign / red light in front of a drunk driver, contributing to the cancellation of the session.

And they threatened some pills that would make me vomit up blood for about three weeks, during which I can only eat green...shit.   So today, I got in there right after school. Somehow I've become this uber-being doc model since I was last there...some sort of epitome of health...o except that hole in the guts thing. For some reason they ask a lot of weird questions these days, like GPA. They asked how old I was at least ten times, no joke.  But then...the doctor was prodding my guts and she happened to hit the very spot where it kills...it was a thousand thousand colours, it was incredible. So she said Upper GI (gastro-intestinal) for tomorrow...I get to miss school, yip!, well some of it...which basically means I get to drink chalk and get about three hours of X-rays in the process, so they can make sure I have something to talk about. And if I do, that means I've had an ulcer for the last six years of my existence, and I could see where that could have caused some of those stomach problems I've had over the couple of months.  NOT TO MENTION taking a topical medication that is highly inflammatory to the guts since about the same time! WHEE! So blah...I get to go to another clean place tomorrow, and I don't deal with doctor's offices really well innately. But then they say, 'We need to get some blood work, 'k hun?' Little girly laugh after.  I haven't had blood taken since I was a lot smaller, before I was able to be stuck in the arm...and what worse, I don't take to needles more than I don't take to doctor's offices. And these people...for crying out loud...the blood room's in the basement, they already have Halloween decorations up...and they're the scariest frickin' things in the universe. And it smelled funny...much like places full of skin, blood, and piss samples will smell like.   But I have veins like tree trunks so it was all good. She stuck me with the biggest needle in the known universe, and get this: as soon as she started drawing the blood, I laughed. Sadist? I suppose. But I laughed out loud and she laughed with me, for some reason. And thusly shaken, I went to the bathroom and lo, what should be sitting there on the sink counter but a sticker! It's of a weasel, and it's from Canada! Huzzah for moi! Stickin' that sucker on the guitar as soon as I write my report here...ya know...the one for Calhoun that I never did...that's right kids! Doing it right now. I have to try and remember how many quotes per chapter, the length of the essay, and what it's even about...*cry*. But I just thought I should tell you all about my little experience and hopefully you'd all get a good laugh out of my fear of being impaled.  Bon voyage.    "

For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

I also added 'Thanks again for calling, and make it a great day!'  (I'm sure that our creditors will be glad to hear it.)  In other news, on the way to a men's meeting at church on Tuesday evening, I received a traffic ticket for running a red light.  After getting the citation from the police officer, I had half a mind to turn around and return home.  I'm glad I didn't; being around other spiritual men helped me to get a better perspective and deal with my emotions.  I do plan to head to court next week to contest the ticket.  We'll see what happens.  Keisha has been having a lot of wetting accidents at school.  She's been taking medicine for bladder spasms, but it does not seem to taking care of the problem.  Yesterday afternoon she had another accident, and nearly all of the other kids in the classroom laughed at her.  In terms of academic aptitude, I would have to say that Keisha is near the head of her class.  So much so that the other kids like to hang around her to see how she does things.  Yet it's hard when she loses control of her bladder.  She came home yesterday and drew a picture of herself.  The face in the picture had tears.  More to come later.  My time on the computer at the library is up for now.         ",

But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.

My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.

The blog is no longer being updated, but it contains several interesting ideas; some of which I thought of.  For example:  Do you have any songs in your music library that have the same title but are from different artists? Do you have any that are not covers (i.e., remakes) of the original song but still have the same title? (  Feb 26 '03 ) Do you have, or have you ever had, any chronic illnesses? For example, for the first 7 years of my life I could practically count on getting an earache. (  Feb 22 '03 ) Post an entry in a foreign language that you know. (  Jan 22 '03 ) With that in mind, let me encourage you to let me know if you post about any of these topics.  I'm interested in your thoughts.         ",

Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",

She may not be acting like it right now, but in all honesty, that's her deal.  Right now she's way too caught up in her own life to be able to see past it and into yours (or mine, but once again, not quite the point.)  Truthfully, I really haven't talked to her enough in the past month to really know what's going on, but I do know that yall are in love and that's just not something that fades away that quickly.    I do know that making a big deal out of Abby's lack of insight is not going to make the situation any better.  Just don't obsess about things that don't matter in the long run.  I promise you, girls think about things a lot differently than guys do.  With us, we can do anything as friends that guys would perceive as a 'date' or whatever.  I promise you, Abby would never in a million years do anything she thought would hurt you in any way.  Is she in an incessantly bad mood right now?  Yes.  Is she able to see past her own problems right now?  No.  I've pretty much faded into the background the past month.  Remember her calling you and telling you that I was completely ignoring her, blah blah blah?  Yeah, right here, right now.  I haven't really talked to her in forever it seems like.  But she's still my best friend and I still love her.  I do understand the whole feeling of despair, though...quite unfortunately.  And I'm really sorry you're back feeling that way again.  That's sucks infinitely.  But listen to me: you aren't doing anything wrong.  If anything, you're doing stuff that is very right.  You've been there for me when even Abby couldn't be.  You've loved me when I couldn't love myself, and forced me to look at things from your persective.  You are the perfect boyfriend, the perfect son, and the perfect friend, even if most of us can't see it all the time.  You are my brother, Josh.  I look up to you and respect you more than any one else I can think of.  Your advice and compassion and support has gotten me farther in this world than I ever dreamed possible.  I don't know what I would have done these past couple of years without you.    But please, Josh, don't let this get you down into another Leigh Anne situation.  It really shouldn't- there's no Leigh Anne situation to pull you down, only your perception of one.  Every couple goes through rough times; this is just one of the rockier ones that yall will eventually either through and be closer than ever before.  Don't be ashamed that you're feeling the way you do- just know that not everything is exactly the way you think it is.  You are so awesome, Josh.  Thank you so much for coming tonight- that really meant a lot, especially since my family couldn't be there.  You have been so wonderful to me over the past couple of years- I'm not sure I'll ever be able to thank you enough or repay the debt.  Knowing you has changed my life, and I'm so grateful it has.    If you ever need to talk, you know I'm always here.  My door's always open, my phone is always on, and you are always welcome.      "

The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.

This is being merketed toward my little sister.    Abercrombie & Fitch to your kids: Group sex now!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: November 14, 2003 1:00 a.m. Eastern    2003 WorldNetDaily.com    Forty-five specific portrayals of sexual imagery in the first 120 pages, advice to the readers ... this is how the new Abercrombie & Fitch Quarterly titled 'The Christmas Field Guide' begins its new quarterly magazine that is targeted to your 10- to 13-year-olds. The 45 images include overt portrayals of group sex, lots of teen and young adult nudity, men kissing, and teens /young adults frolicking in a river engaging in sexual activity in multiple group settings.   Did I mention that the actual clothing doesn't begin being advertised until page 120?   Abercrombie & Fitch are not new to this game and they are taking a huge bet this Christmas season. The wager is ... you won't care enough to do anything about it.   For the last four years a handful of concerned parents and citizens have been waging a miniature war on the popular teen clothier. Each year, the clothier has made hollow gestures at trying to 'reform its act.' But these attempts are not only insincere, they are laughable. Laughable  but they are not funny.   Each year, thousands of children across America beg their parents to get them the latest t-shirt, jeans, jacket or underwear from 'A&F.' (Yes they even market a line of thongs for 8- to 10-year-old girls made to stick up out of the 'low cut' jeans they also sell.) Many of these parents, completely unaware of how 'A&F' goes about marketing, plunk down thousands of dollars around the holidays ... and Abercrombie & Fitch continues to profit.   This year will be different. Thousands of consumers are being put on alert as to the marketing methods of the clothier, web-log writers are going to be commenting on it, church and para-church groups are organizing protests, and this year we will even advise investors via direct links to popular business Internet sites like CBS Marketwatch as to the marketing methods the company is willing to use.   After all, they do say, 'We don't just sell clothes, we promote a lifestyle!' And what kind of 'lifestyle'?   Well, in this year's issue in the 'sexpertise' column on page 279, a lady presumably qualified to be referred to as a 'sexpert' states that kids going to college this year, 'shouldn't be looking for someone to marry.' Nope, when it comes to sex, kids should be 'focused on getting experience.' The 'sexpert' is also asked about and gives advice concerning the issue of doing 'sex for three.' She also advises readers to be willing to 'go down' on a date at the movies, 'just so long as you do not disturb those around you.' And, of course, what kind of column would a 'sexpertise' column be if it did not address the issue of self-stimulation.   There is also a comparison column for the hormonally driven young men in the 'A&F' readership comparing the 'fruits' of biting into 'fresh apple right off the tree' vs. the 'store-bought variety that sit on the shelf wrinkled and bruised from the handling.' This column is not comparing fruit at all but the benefits of teenage men sleeping with perky school girls vs. 'sexy' older women, even married ones.   So the plan of action?   This year's is multi-fold:     Read this column and forward it to everyone you know.   Dial the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families (toll free) 888-877-7723.   Add your voice to the growing list of parents, teens and citizens who wish to see sexually transmitted disease rates reduced, and less teen pregnancy by signing the letter of protest at Stop A&F.   And by all means spend no money with Abercrombie & Fitch this year. (American Eagle, H&M and a variety of other clothiers provide clothing that is equally fashionable to the style of Abercrombie & Fitch  but without the unnecessary nudity and sexualization of Americans aged 10 to 18.)   In a day in which more parents than ever are concerned about the likelihood of their daughter getting pregnant, their child being sexually active long before they are mature enough to handle the consequences or the rampant spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the 'younger than 20' demographic today  it's time to stop Abercrombie & Fitch.   Abercrombie & Fitch is wagering you won't care about what they do, so they've rolled the dice. For me, my money is on the decency of you and the hope you have for the future of your kids.   So ... I'll take that bet!        "

The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.

I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.

A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail.  Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. 'I had never been treated like that in my life,' he said. 'I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed.'  Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.  'We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,' said Dr. Rajcoomar. 'So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.'                ",

      "3": "           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             ",

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          ",

When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             ",

But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons.

So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party.

Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.  I feel both sides, for or against, are presenting only partially convincing arguments.  Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.

The song  Black  was a nice depressing ballad through the last couple of rainy days; there's a piano in it and it somehow reminds me of rain. And, my dad was playing this album non-stop during the carefree days of five years old...ELEVEN FUCKING YEARS AGO...and it reminds me of that, as well.

I think that it's just a stupid and bad thing I always do when I'm met with new situations: I try to adapt to everything more than I need to, and I end up bludgeoning everything in the wake of aftermath, and knocking holes in everyone, not disincluding myself.   Lord, this remind me of last year, sitting here making stupid EMO posts for hours. Honeybunches of oats. That's my new curse.  And speaking of EMO...I started an EMO band care of Billy Bassett. We were talking about how I look like Cousin It with my hair all in my face, and then we were talking about how cool EMO is, and then I was like...'Dude...that's the name of my EMO band...Cousin It.' And Billy said it was a great name. So. I'm going to start writing EMO songs now! Woo! I'm an EMO kid and I hate my life. And you dumped me in the fifth grade...so I'm gonna make me die.  That would be the name of my production company, too.  I'm Gonna Kill Me  Music, in case anyone wants me to produce them. Oh hell. I'm not really concerned with that right now.

He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",

We did that ourselves, out of our own free will.  If you'll remember, Liz and I were originally on Becca's side.    What we need to do is what we planned on Friday.  Have Josh talk to her because he's on best terms with her, and well, nobody in their right mind can get too mad at Josh.  I've tried it, it's pretty impossible.  Then when she comes back in the room, perhaps we can talk it out rationally, but I'm starting to really doubt it.    There is not going to be peace again.  Ever.  But everyone is going to have to deal with the fact that a stalemate basically means that she's out of our little 'group' and that we're more of acquaintances than friends.  Not neccessarily enemies, but definitely not friends.  Never again friends, no matter how much wishing.  It would take a change not only of heart, but identity as well, and everyone knows that will never happen.  Rosie, like I said on the phone, this isn't just a mindset.  This is Becca.  This isn't just some cover-up of insecurity.  She TRULY thinks that she's better than us, that we are supposed to worship her, and that her life, her problems, are much more important than everyone else's.  Remember the day Liz told yall her parents were getting divorced, and Becca told her that she didn't care because some distant uncle that I KNOW she's only seen once, like when she was four, was dying?  That was the biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen, but she truly believed that her distant uncle was more important than Liz's parents.  Let me ask you, how many times has that been mentioned ever again?  Oh yeah, never.  Whereas Liz broke down the other day over her parents (not to make you look weak, Liz, but to illustrate my point.)  I'm not saying Becca's problems aren't important, I'm saying that a good friend supports her friends, not try to make her problems look bigger than everyone else's.  And she definitely doesn't yell at someone who is on the verge of tears and antagonize them until they break down.  That is not what a friend does.  A friend hugs and listens, and dispenses tissues.  Do I dare say that Becca has NEVER been our friend?  Yes, I dare.      "

The administration has declined to estimate how long U.S. forces would remain in Iraq.

      "1": "           I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.  It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clampdown on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.  It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year.  As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.  Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.  Er, I'd better go.  *or, Eva informs me, Virginia. Damn it, that's another Christmas tradition that I'll have to miss this year.         ",

Nancy Reagan to Bush: 'We Don't Support Your Re-Election'    The widow of former President, and Republican icon, Ronald Reagan has told the GOP she wants nothing to do with their upcoming national convention or the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush.   Nancy Reagan turned down numerous invitations to appear at the Republican National Convention and has warned the Bush campaign she will not tolerate any use of her or her late husbands words or images in the Presidents re-election effort.  Mrs. Reagan does not support President Bushs re-election and neither to most members of the Presidents family, says a spokesman for the former First Lady...  ...The Reagans split with Bush and the party centers around stem cell research which many believe can help find a cure for Alzheimers, the disease that crippled President Reagan in his final years. Bush and the ultra-conservative wing of the Republican Party oppose use of new stem cells. The Reagans, with the exception of Michael [Reagan], support such use.  Theres more to the feud than that, however. Nancy Reagan has told close followers she believes Bush and the current Republican leadership have divided America with their extreme views. She has told Republican leaders she wants nothing to do with the party or Bush.  During the week of Reagans funeral, the former First Lady went ballistic when she learned the Bush campaign was test marketing new ads that used Reagans photos and speeches in an effort to show he supported Bush and his re-election. She personally called Republican Party Chief Ed Gillespie to demand the ads be destroyed.   read the rest of this article   here ; the 'missing' bit from what i posted here concerns the adopted Reagan son Michael, who does indeed support Bush.

He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter, opened the cupboard and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it on the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands, mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten. Brandon was covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something very good for Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't know what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove and he didn't know how the stove worked!)  Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and reached to push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his pajamas white and sticky.  And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.  Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was coming, maybe even a spanking. But his father just watched him.  Then, walking through the mess, Dad picked up his crying son, hugged him and loved him, getting his own pajamas white and sticky in the process.  That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it turns into a mess. Our marriage gets all sticky or we insult a friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.  That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some of our mess gets all over Him.  But just because we might mess up, we can't stop trying to 'makepancakes' for God or for others. Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...  Please pass some of this love on to others....suppose one morning you were called to God; do all your friends know you love them?  I was thinking ... and I wondered if I had any wounds needing to be healed, friendships that need rekindling or three words needing to be said. Sometimes, 'I love you' can heal & bless.  Remind every one of your friends that you love them, even if you think they don't love back.  You would be amazed at what those three little words, a smile, and a reminder like this can do. So I share this with you, and offer this encouragement.  Share this with everyone you love, and make sure to share it again with the person who shared it with you. And never stop 'making pancakes'!!!         ",

Something is definitely up, though.  Well, 42nd Street was really good, but I almost fell asleep during intermission.  My mom was like, 'well, that just shows you're not back to 100% yet.'  I was like, sure mom.  But then I didn't have to go to church and I got to sleep late, so hey, I wasn't too upset.  And you're right about no one responding (you're just right about everything tonight!) ever since you came.  People are forgetting about me. *sob*  Actually, Josh doesn't always have a computer...but everyone else does, though.  Oh, well.  Not that big of a deal.  People get to it when they can.  Oh, and Rosie, what was up with your mom when i called today?  I said 'Hello, is rosie there?'  And she goes 'Rosie not available' and I heard you go, 'But, mom!' And she goes 'No, not available' and hangs up on me.  It was kind of amusing with the accent, but it kind of worried me, but apparently you aren't grounded, or you're going all 'Lindsey' on me.  Anyway, I'll see yall tomorrow except for Abby, who I'll talk to tomorrow.  Bya.  (Ha.  Beat you to it, Abby! [She made that up])      "

Yep, that's right.  ;)  Just kidding.  Glad everything was cool with your cousins, and sorry to hear that you made everyone mad and that you left your cell phone there.  And you neglected to tell me that you CUT your HAIR.  YOU.  LINDS.  MS. 'I DON'T CUT MY HAIR' GIRL.  So...anyway, enough with the caps.  A big enthusiastic hello to everyone.

      "2": "           I liked the idea of that as an offence - maybe that could've been a way out of being burned as a witch.  As a non-American blogger I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since I started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) I suppose I'd better say something.  Firstly, I think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts.  The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.   Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't  a priori  represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.  The flag may represent freedom to you, but that doesn't mean freedom is affected by burning it, any more than terror, torture, coersion and death vanish when it's burned by someone to whom it represents those things.  It follows that you can't just argue against flag-burning by ascribing some meaning to the flag and saying that the flag-burner must dissapprove of this meaning.    ' by doing so [burning the flag], they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead. The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot .'    Couldn't they be saying just about anything about the US?  Maybe they don't like the choice of milkshakes available there.  It's a little unfair to assume that it's the  positive  things they don't like.  And if they're  really  free to do it, why does taking advantage of that freedom in fact imply any protest at all?  By that logic, having gay sex is a protest against a country that grants the freedom to indulge in it.  I'm sure no-one would say, 'by having gay sex, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead - the lifestyle that allows them to have gay sex without being arrested or shot.' (This might be a bad example to anyone reading in Georgia*) That said, I think there are tactical reasons, as a protestor, to avoid burning flags - be they the Stars'n'Stripes, the Union Jack, the Tricolore or the Star of David - unless you're a citizen of the country that flag represents.  Unless your point really is 'I hate all Americans/British/French/Jews', in any of which cases I'd really rather not be marching alongside you, that's the message you're going to put across to people in that country.   I was pleased to note, on the march against Bush, that almost every banner and speaker was careful to differentiate between GWB and the population he claims to represent.  I would have felt uncomfortable if someone had burned an American flag, because of the indiscriminate message that would put across to people watching in the US (Yeah, like it made the headlines).  I have zero sentimental or political attachment to my country's flag, but I still feel if I see it burned overseas that I probably wouldn't be welcome at that particular party (unless it's one of those 'Hindus For The Abolition of Primary Colors' demonstrations - those guys are alright).  OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'.  I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.  It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clampdown on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.  It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year.  As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.  Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.  Er, I'd better go.  *or, Eva informs me, Virginia. Damn it, that's another Christmas tradition that I'll have to miss this year.         ",
      "3": "           And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario:  Yes, we're at a party, and yes, we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's 'Dead Man's Party' sounds pretty good to me right now...), and yes, we'd love for everyone to dance. But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.         ",
      "4": "       Thanks for that, Linds.  I'm beginning to think that this whole Glen thing really isn't bothering me. Speaking of empathy, this has a lot to do with my resentments and inner quarrels more than that. My mother being there or not...there isn't much I can do about that. It's to the point that no matter what I say, I can't change a damn thing about her never being here, and I've come to accept that. It would have to come to the point of me failing a suicide attempt to get that attention. I know because...  Well here's where it gets tricky. I know this because of my  dad's  little deal back in ninth grade...he didn't give a shit either way about us in the midst of that wonderful rendezvous. When he broke up with that girl he even went so far as to  blame  me for it, to make me feel guilty and rub it in my face; that's how far gone he was...and that's a lot of reason why I haven't forgiven him entirely. This situation with my mom is reminiscent of that one; not that Glen is a bad person, but that my world is enveloped by him, regardless of what I think I can do about it, Glen is a part of my life and I refuse to accept him entirely...out of fear.  Out of fear of losing it again and going back into those wonderful days of rain and dark black and Slipknot and suicide and general fear of everything, want of love that wasn't there: finding a replacement love and finding out all too late it was the wrong kind.   I don't think it would be that drastic this time around...it's happened before, and I have some definite positive reinforcement this time around...but it's like being able to sense danger...it's an instinct. It's being able to feel the rain coming from a once-broken bone, to feel the hairs standing up on the back of your neck, to smell a gas leak and think 'Peligro!' (en espagnol!). It's insecurity and it bugs the crap out of me.  But this is all going to go ok because I have Abby, who provides that love that so happens to be the right kind this time around, I have this BLog and all of it's wonderful inhabitants, and I have a self-assurance this time, I have learned that I don't have to kiss ass 24/7 just to have people like me: I have bad days like everyone else, fuck the ones who can't cope with the fact that I may just be having a pretty bitter existence at the moment.  I wrote all that because I was scared and I ran to the BLog looking for the answer...but the BLog can't come to the answers, only I can; we, ourselves, are the only ones that can answer our own questions and straighten our own affairs, we are the ones that need to decide the here and now. Advice is good for directing us at the right answer...but the fact remains, resolution is always better than vacillation.  JD (drum teacher) heard our CD today...well, mine. Stranglebox is genuinely falling to pieces. I'm pretty sure I'm letting go of Alex and trying to assimilate Nick...but that's another story.  JD first listened to  I'm Just A Bastard  after screwing with a few of the preliminary tracks, he just sat with his head down and listened. Then I started singing and his head darted up and he said, 'I like that effect on your voice, man,' and he looked like I had just started some f-ing revolution. He said to go to 4,  Painpainted , and noted that I was peaking out at first (that's a bad thing), but as the song went he started laughing to himself...he flipped out on this one. 'Did you do the drums?...Yea?...They're badass...You're a really good vocalist, man...I'm digging those harmonies...You're an incredible songwriter...' and on and on and on.  And yes, I'm showing off a little. The reason this is really landmark, however, is that when he heard  My Solution  way back he was sort of unimpressed. He liked the way the song was written but it needed some serious work. This time he was bugging out. He about pissed himself during  Broken Me  in that cool little off-time drum section, and the part before the off-time drum section, and most of the song, for that matter. Altho he said it wasn't sonically 'rockin'' yet, I'm pretty sure he was more than damned impressed by all of that. So maybe he'll produce us? That would be awesome considering the guy is a genius.  So I'm really tired and I hate making frickin' big posts, altho I know that every time I post I always make a huge one...sorry all. Kinda why I don't get on as much anymore.  But whatever. Here's lookin' at you, kids.    "

Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was   www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the   Mis-Lead .         ",

Most of it contains information I've already mentioned here, yet there are some unique aspects that still deemed it worthy of a link here.  As I read the article, I found myself trying to look between the lines to see where and how the information conveyed helps me as a job seeker (Even though I currently have a job, I still find myself wanting to behave as though I'm still looking, albeit not as aggressively.).  How does this same information I've read before affect my job search in the short term and long term?  I used to work for an IT consulting company.  I now work at a hotel as a bartender.  I like the change, but more specifically, I like that I'm making money to help support my family.  I was willing to take this job, even though I don't get paid the same income I had as a consultant.  One thing I know the condition of the economy and job market has affected me is that I've had to seriously examine the kind of work I used to do and ask myself if I wanted to continue down that path or pursue something different.  I think that a number of individuals are in the same situation.  So, read the USA Today article with a grain of salt, and use what you learn to help you figure out what you can do to improve your job situation.  As always, comments are welcome and appreciated!

Perhaps there were several Ivans in his neighborhood.  It became necessary to distinguish which Ivan he was.  So he added some form of 'Johnson' to his name and became Ivan Johnson, or some variant of that.  Whether it was really in Sweden or somewhere else, I've come to realize that by doing research on the origin of my last name won't get me very far.  I only have to look in the local phone book to see how many 'Johnsons' there are.  I'm sure that my great-grandfather Ivan from Sweden probably changed his name somewhere between the time when he lived in Sweden and the time when he arrived at Ellis Island, in New York near the turn of the 20th century.  I've certainly found several variants myself: Johannsen, Johanssen, Johanson, and so on.  I'm not surprised that there are many other 'Dan Johnson's' on the Internet.         ",

Hmm... the more  unusual  drinks?   Bend Me Over  is one.  It contains a shot (1 fl. oz.) of   Crown Royal whiskey , a shot of Amaretto liqueur, and a splash of Sweet & Sour mix.  Another one is something called a  Fired Up Friday .  It contains a shot of Peach Schnapps, a shot of Cranberry Juice, and a small amount of Bacardi 151 rum.  151 is the 'proof,' which means that it contains 75.5% alcohol by volume.  The bottle actually has a flammable warning and a flame retardant seal.  I poured so many of them one night that I just about gagged from the Peach Schnapps smell.  I love to mix drinks, but I would probably never drink them myself.  One drink that I actually tasted back in bartending school was called a  Red, White, and Blue .  This is a drink that I would love to have again.  Unfortunately, it's not that big.  In a 1 oz. 'Pony' glass, you layer Grenadine, White Cr&eacute;me de Cacao, and Blue Curacao by 'spoon-floating' each liqueur, respectively, 1/3 of the way into the glass.  I've been aching to make this drink for the military folks that comprise the majority of the guests at the bar where I work.  Right now, I'm waiting for us to get some White Cr&eactut;me de Cacao.  Sometimes, I suggest different drinks to people who may not know exactly what they want.  About a month or so ago, I suggested a  Blue Margarita  to one lady, and she wound up getting her friends to like it as well.  It's made just like a regular Margarita, except that it uses Blue Curacao instead of Triple Sec.  It tastes exactly the same, too.  Only the color is different.  The recipe is 1-1/2 oz of Tequila, 1/2 oz of Blue Curacao, 1/2 oz of Rose's Lime Juice, and 3 oz of Sweet and Sour mix.  I also suggested a  Sloe Screw  to one lady.  It contains 1 oz of Sloe Gin (which tastes like strawberries) and 2 oz. of Orange Juice.  Any drink name that with a sexual connotation has Orange Juice (Screwdriver, Harvey Wallbanger, for example).  More interesting trivia for you to share with your friends.         ",

I can't tell you where we're coming from, but I can say very poetically, yet truly, that we come from a place that reeks of decay and fright, a dead fear of something we can't give a name to.  Ah yes, normal. A term used by the failed experiment called psychology to encompass an average. Who defines normal? It's the same people that define what certain words mean. Who defines what 'pen' means? Did you all read 'Frindle'? If so, you'd know the answer. It was a person, the same creature that breaths, fucks, shits, eats, just like all the rest of us, no different, no more safe from dying, getting lucky, or anything than any of the rest of us. It's someone that still has a seizure threshold, has to pay taxes, keeps a circadian rhythm, all that good shit. Normal is over-rated and pointless.  No one can see inside like this, we may be outcasted to some extent...so what? We already talked about this before, yet still, this might be good for everyone else to hear: why bleed yourself over someone that's going to think they're better than you because you have a 'problem'? The only difference between us and those people is that ours has a given name in a failed experiment/psychology book. Someone who says they don't have problems is a fucking liar. There's their problem right there: denial of problems. If you don't have them, you will. If you deny them, you're fucked. Life is all about accepting their occurance and taking them as they come, depressed as one could be or no.  I say down with the distinction, I say fuck psychology and their godawful classifications, I say separate the diagnosis branch from the treatment branch, because its current incarnation is causing all within it quite a bit of isolation, self-doubt. It's in some people's nature to doubt everyone else, this is only making it worse.  Yet still, they will not, no one's really listening to me, really. All I can tell you is my two favorite words in the whole world when it comes to things like this: FUCK IT. Fuck them, sorry you all, but fuck you. If you don't like me, blow me. If you can't deal with it and shut the fuck up about it, even if you were my best friend before, then suck on my goddamn goads because you are a complete fucking retard. And people, that's just the way it goes, that last sentence may have been a bit abrasive, but that's what everyone really needs to hear: the cold, hard truth of it, just like life really is. It might be better for some of us to hear it that way rather than me just pussy-footing around it with demure, blas language than to tell it to you with all the hatred and anger I can conjure from myself, and I did. You need to hear that I don't care who you are, I don't care how many of you have to go before I get it all straight: if you can't accept it, then you're the one that has problems, you're not helping me and I don't need you, and more over, you're not helping yourself.  I can see the day people like that wake up and figure out: 'oh my god, what have I done?' That awful, awful day you come to realize that everyone is the same, everyone's fucked up as you are, nobody understands a motherfucking thing, everyone's drowning in something. Yeah, we all are. But the fun of life is taking that next big breath, and if we can respect everyone's right to take it, and respect the fact that no one really can have real dignity while they're drowning, then it's all right.  Life is about the right now, it's about coming to accept that there's a lot of shit here, and the only way to make yourself happy is to do just that: MAKE. No one was put here to give you anything. You can choose your miseries and your elations, even if you're messed up like we are. We can fight the feelings, we don't have to be one way or the other, we can just be ok. I don't have to be manic or depressed, I can just be in the middle. It's not all brain chemistry. If that were the case, we'd never fucking be alright, no one really understand the brain all that well.   Humanity is better than every other species becase we have a choice. Life is about taking that choice and making the most of it, respecting everyone else's choices, and choosing the things that will really make us happy, maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but sometime. And in the mean time, we can life with the happiness of knowing that we made the right decisions. Everything can really work out if you know what your options are.  The secret is just taking a step, whether you know where it leads, whether you can walk or not. MAKE your way, and you can take another great big breath. Hell, one day you may even reach the shore for good.    "

Huge trust issues, so please bear with me.  Nevertheless, I'm over it all now. 2) Am I insane in thinking that I let you all know when I would be back?  I could have sworn that I posted or e-mailed or TOLD someone when I'd be getting back.  If not, then I apologize for my negligence, my being an ass, and the subsequent hindrance of your making plans.   3) Anything but those days that we're mentoring should work fine.   4) Please call me soon.  I've been trying to get in touch with you for quite some time but neither of our schedules have been working out favorably for that.  Maybe I'm a little testy, because I felt neglected.  Stupidly, I admit, but still.  As for everyone else:  Rosie:  I was glad to see you today @ The Torture Chamber/ Chasm Leading Straight To Hell/ School.  It's been a while.  Will: Again, glad to know you liked the postcard.  Your e-mail was definitely diverting and I enjoyed it.    Josh: You don't talk too much.  I liked hearing from you, too.   Now having dispensed with the formalities, let me please reiterate that I apologize for overreacting, if that was what I did, but I've learned that the only person I can really trust is myself and I'm working on extending that to my mom and to you all.  It is working pretty well...but hell, we all have setbacks sometimes, right?  Just tolerate me.  Hopefully this will be the last time I have to discuss the 'D' word on this site.  I'll reserve that for mine.  ~Z       "

The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that some of Bushs Guard files may have been intentionally dumped ahead of his presidential run in 2000:   Retired National Guard Lt. Col. Bill Burkett said Tuesday that in 1997, then-Gov. Bushs chief of staff, Joe Albaugh, told the National Guard chief to get the Bush file and make certain theres not anything there that will embarrass the governor.   Col. Burkett said that a few days later at Camp Mabry in Austin, he saw Mr. Bushs file and documents from it discarded in a trash can.

All politicians create a reality for us -- a necessity for all leaders, the fictionalizing of the public self -- and any thinking person can easily see through the smoke.  However, it disturbs me when the smoke is this obvious -- not because it reflects badly on the politician (who is doing what all leaders must do), but because it reveals an alarming assumption of the simple-mindedness of the public.  If the article is factual on this point, I would have preferred if Bush had said he heard about it through an aide, or that it was confusing and no one clearly knew what was going on, than to create a story about watching it on television.  If true, it is a silly and unnecessary lie.  Beyond that one point, the rest of the article kind of rolled over me as a sea of timestamps and vague outrage.  Conspiracy?  No.  Confused and silly humans?  Sure.  Unnecessary fictionalizing?  You bet.         ",

The fact that recruiters have access to their potential employees whole life history is a violation of personal freedom. Criminal backround checks, for example, should notify the employer if the person is a murderer, a bank robber, or a rapist. In light of technological advances, an employer may look at a minor offense on the prospective employee's record as a reflection of the way that person is, no matter if they have changed or not.  I think employers should be trained to be more empathetic when making a decision on whether or not to hire. I also think that employers shouldn't have the right to inspect a person's history that isn't relevant to the future job. For example, if a rapist applies for a job taking care of people, the answer of course would be 'no'. If a bank robber applies for as a cashier, the answer again: 'no'. However, if a person who has a history of drunken driving applies for a job as a janitor then the fact that the drunken driving record has no relevance to the job applied for then the history sould be taken note on but shouldn't interfere with the chance of getting the job, unless of course the job involves driving, if the person hasn't been through some sort of rehabilitation.

My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?

Ah, well, not like he acted on his knowledge, but close enough I guess.  I'm proud of you Josh.  Three days without Abby (without one of you being out of town) is hard.  And I'm proud of you for humbling yourself and writing the letter.  I'm sure you're doing the right thing.  Ok, enough mushy stuff, I know you hate, so I'll see you later.    "

Which means that Neo -- again, the physical body of Keanu Reeves -- has now experienced *six* violent liberations from his physical stasis pod.

Let me say that again.  Cry.  Me.  Z.  The implacable.  Or something.  ;) And then again, she didn't really do it, but I was in such a bad mood to begin with that arguing with her and trying to prove how much pain I was in made me cave.  But I'm doing better now.  Honest.  Well, I think.  I also was upset for Becca at the time.  Obviously I know what it's like to lose people, whether they're leaving or dying, but I had no idea that this was some DISTANT relation.  For all I know, she really did care, except for Linds's testimony, but I can't believe that she would dare to think that an uncle, distant or not, is more important than someone's HOME LIFE FALLING DOWN AROUND HER.    I'm sorry if that was extraordinarily bitchy or mean or selfish, but now I'm really pissed off.  More so than I was before.  Linds was also right in the original sides thing.  Rosie, you really didn't turn me to your side.  I found out information, some from you and some from Linds or Will or whoever else, and that was what made me change my mind.  So don't feel guilty about it, Little China.  *grin*  Anyway, just had to say that.  Um, two things.  1) What did you mean when you said that Phillip's like me?  Just curious.  And 2) Those seniors have no idea what they're talking about, except for the biased story they've heard from Becca.  I mean, are they your friends, aside from Gunter?  If so, I don't know what you should do, but if not, then tell them to fuck off.  I'm serious.  They have no business getting involved.  Period.  Abby, I thought you knew me.  Kind of.  I'm not sure of that, but I thought you did.  ;)  hehehe  Also...if you don't want to hear anymore about the divorce, let me know, but I'm kind of using this Blog to get it off my chest.  I don't really have another place.  Anyway, this weekend my dad and I had bonding time.  ALL SATURDAY.  It was all right, but not really awesome except that I did get to see X2 which was REALLY GOOD.  Anyway, on Saturday I went to his new house.  Not to stay but just to look around.  It's in Mooreland, that place on Moores Lane on the way to the mall.  It's really little and WHITE.  It feels like a sterile environment.  I'm making him have my room painted.  Anyway, that's about it, but it was pretty hard to do it.  Don't think he picked up on that, so I guess that I'm making it through all right.  So, back to Operation Becca, just one question.  What the hell are we actually going to do about it?  Please let me know just so I have an inkling.    I feel like I should be really guilty about something or other right now.   Nah.  ;)  ~Z        ",

      "1": "           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         ",

For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S.

After that I knew the war was on-- So we fought: He said: 'The apple-cart like a broomstick-angel snaps and splinters old dutch shoes.' I said: 'Lightning will strike the old oak and free the fumes!' He said: 'Mad street with no name.' I said: 'Bald killer! Bald killer! Bald killer!' He said, getting real mad, 'Firestoves! Gas! Couch!' I said, only smiling, 'I know God would turn back his head if I sat quietly and thought.' We ended by melting away, hating the air!'  Wasn't that great? Life is really cool now.  Later, friends.    "

      "2": "           Warning - The following post is given a grade of F for political correctness because it is anti-tax, and somewhat pro-smoker.  I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.         ",

It must be strange for him, spending time with someone who's head of state even though they weren't elected, just because of who their family is.  The security crackdown here is unbelievable.  I read in yesterday's newspaper that 1 in 9 policemen, nationwide, is involved in the security operation surrounding Bush. Half the police in all of London, too, apparently.  If I weren't marching tomorrow, I think I'd carry out a few burglaries as far from George as possible.  Eva and I have been talking about ways of protesting Bush while making it difficult for the media to portray it as mindless 'anti-Americanism', which is an accusation Blair has made, predictably.  Any ideas?  Richard Dawkins said he wanted to see a burning American flag behind Bush in every shot, but Eva thinks this'll just look threatening to people in the US, and I can see her point.  Oh, and I think most of the protestors will be from the UK, but there'll be be some from elsewhere, including plenty from the US, if experience serves.         ",

According to a recent FranklinCovey survey, statistics show that by February 1, most of these resolutions will have failed and the people who set them will have fallen back into the same habits they tried to eliminate just one month earlier.  However, statistics also show that setting realistic goals, adopting a plan of action and sticking to that plan can be the deciding factor in the ability to successfully achieve a goal.  According to the study:  78% of successfully achieved goals had plans. 84% of goals were successfully achieved within the original plan     ",

'The article '20 Minutes To A More Natural You' suggests an application of under-eye concealer, light powder, natural lip gloss, and clear mascara to achieve the makeup-free look,' said Michelle Karns-Daley, spokeswoman for the American Association of Cosmetology.

They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         ",

That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.

MxPx has another good one along those lines, but it's more male-oriented, some girl pulling some dude's heart out...like, literally. It sounds gross but it just looks hilarious.  Why won't guys talk? I don't know. Do all girls want to listen? It's really a matter of some guys are different than others, some guys have learned or have been taught differently over time. Some guys just can't stand to hear themselves say it, because it just sounds really self-defeating and repetetive...I would tag any communication problems with that one there. Generally, we hate doing it because it means facing things we don't want to see, and going places we really don't want to go, and even if it's about facing them with someone you love and trust, we fear the depression that comes inevitably, we don't want to bring that on these people that we care about.  It's a really difficult thing, and honestly it runs a lot deeper than I know, and I live in it. But still...it's something I can more feel and outwardly talk about than to actually explain the schematics of it. Maybe he will come around, and maybe he won't. And maybe you'll get so fed up one day, that you'll tell him to talk and he will. Or maybe, it'll be the end of the both of you. Yes, it's back to those horrible concepts: time and patience. Things really just don't unfold like a picnic blanket most of the time...Abby and I did a lot of talking before we started going out, so it might have seemed like some instantaneous process, but it was a project in the works for some time. With you and Rob, you already have the relationship deal going, so you're trying to be the best you can for each other, and unfortuantely, that means putting up a lot of walls because you fear judgment.

Had we known things were going to work out this way from the beginning I would have said yeah, give it a couple of weeks before we decide to get things going...but it hardly works out that way, and didn't. So it comes down to, A. giving it time, or B. doing it yourself. Either of these have their strengths and fallibilities that I'm pretty sure you've already diagnosed or have known for some time now, mostly because we've talked about these before.

      "0": "              Bible Study: Overcoming   Recently while reading some passages in Revelation, I was struck by how often Jesus Christ uses the word 'overcome.'  I thought it would be worthwhile to examine these passages more closely; especially given my present struggles, which I've mentioned here and in   Letters to God .  First of all, there is the word  overcome .  It signifies that trouble, hardship, and the like are  normal  in the life of a disciple of Jesus Christ.  He himself said, in   John 16:33   In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.  We are guaranteed that we will have troubles during our lifetime; our focus, therefore, needs to be on overcoming these things as we journey homeward.  Secondly, I'm encouraged by what   Jesus Christ says will happen to those who overcome , which I've included in the list below.  I've emphasized the words signifying the promise to those who overcome.  'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God  (  Revelation 2:7 ).' 'He who overcomes will  not be hurt at all by the second death  (  Revelation 2:11 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  some of the hidden manna . I will also give him  a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it  (  Revelation 2:17 ).' 'To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give  authority over the nations --      'He will rule them with an iron scepter;      he will dash them to pieces like pottery'--  just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him  the morning star  (  Revelation 2:26-28 ).' 'He who overcomes will, like them,  be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels  (  Revelation 3:5 ).' 'Him who overcomes I will  make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God ; and I will also  write on him my new name  (  Revelation 3:12 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to sit with me on my throne , just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne (  Revelation 3:21 ).' 'He who overcomes will  inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son  (  Revelation 21:7 ).' I don't claim to know all the answers with respect to the symbolism in Revelation, but everything here sounds wonderful, and it encourages me to keep on going.  I'm reminded of   Dory's conversation with Marlin, in the movie Finding Nemo :  Dory:  Hey Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?   Marlin:  No I don't wanna know.   Dory: [singing]  Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.   Marlin:  Dory, no singing.   Dory: [continuing]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho! I love so swim. When you want to swim you want to swim!   Marlin:  Now I'm stuck with that song!. Now it's in my head!   That's what we need to do, even though we don't know exactly where we're heading in the near future.  Just keep swimming.

And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",

I can't think worth shit. The only things I can think are 'eat eat eat', 'pain pain pain' or 'nothingnothingnothing'. Well, I might be thinkin a little more than that, because I made this post.  The sad this is: they gave me an amnesic, to help me forget the proceedure, and while I did, for the most part, these things have an effect on my dad's side of the family of wiping our memory for the entire day. I feel like if I apply myself I might be able to remember what the hell went on today. But, chances are, I'm going to wake up tomorrow, get on the BLog, and wonder when the hell I posted the day before, or, for that matter, if there was a day before.  Alls I know is: drugs are really fucking good. Heheh.  No, really.      "

    "query_text": "           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            ",

I'm working on a story for Elftown. I figure since I'm taking up space with my presence there, I might as well contribute a little, with the best thing I know how to do in the way of art...writing. It was a pretty crazy idea, but I came up with it in the shower this morning (as I do with all crazy ideas). To write the history of man through the eyes of God. Of course, God is a cynic and thinks all human ideas and religions have completely lost it. He toys with his power, he explains the concept of creation and reason for the world's greatest disasters: the Flood, the Black Plague, the Holocaust, and so on, he explains his own creation and the creation of the universe in the best way he knows how...which is, of course, not at all.   It won't be very long. Mostly, it will show coincidences between the plane of God and the mortal realm, and why God think about things the way he does. You might be thinking, 'This is probably some staidly religious story, isn't it?' Let me assure you, if God isn't the way he is in this story, and more in the biblical vein of God, I'm going to fry forever. But it's a great idea, I think. Who'd have ever though of the story of the world from the vantage point of the one who made it...slightly twisting commonly accepted ideals about God, however that may be.  This might take a little longer than I thought, though. It's sort of hard to make God sound assured of his power without being overly cocky. I just need to make him sound like he  knows  he is badass, because he is.   And trust in this, it's hard to do it without lapsing into a few lines of God's laughing uproariously at humanity, because it sounds like he's on the verge of it in this story most of the time.    "

You sit back and stare blankly at the screen, letting a bit of spit fall from your open jaws as you sort through this post and get the message: 'I wanna bitch'. It's the same one tenfold, but for some reason there's something new to get out of it every time.  I'm not intending for this one to be long. Which means it probably will be.  I want you all to know, especially Lindsey, that you all did  not  screw up my life. Let me see if I can retell this plainly.  Leigh Anne called back shortly after Rosie to ask for Brittany's phone number. After a while she handed the phone to Lily. Lily's mom picked up and told her to get off because she needed to use it, whereafter she didn't use it. But anyway, Lily put down the phone and forgot about it.  Meanwhile, I set up this BLog and posted that one at the bottom in Kenzie's, where, shortly after, I deleted it, for reasons that will become apparent in a few lines here.  I had a silent line for 93 minutes before Lily noticed the phone off the hook and picked it up, whereupon she said 'Hello?' and I said, 'Umm...hi,'...there was a round of laughs, then Leigh Anne was inspired to talk to me and say that she was upset with me and didn't hate me anymore. After a minute, she told me they were setting up a tent and that she was going to go and help them. She was trying to get away from them for a second by locking herself in a closet or something, and I didn't think it worked, because she eventually gave in and just said, 'I love you,' and hung up.  So that was ULTRA cool for me. I went and played darts with my sister's friend who was staying over, I won.  They called back shortly after. There were a few more Iluvu's in there, there was some sappiness, which Leigh Anne alleged would happen, and then she hung up at about 1:30, whereafter, Lily tells me, they went to sleep.  So the next day I guess Leigh Anne was still like that for a while. Things went bad at about 5 that evening. They got worse at 6:30. Then I went to my dad's house feeling generally pissed at my dying fortune.  And then that night she just asked me to forget about it again. That she wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone, that she needed a friend. There are some other things that were more personal when we were together that came up, but they eventually were also rescinded until there was nothing left but a big fuckin' gap of silence, whereafter I put down the phone and read your posts. I had said no arguing, I felt like there was some here, so I just decided to call the other people off. Plus Rosie's  ultimately  childish post of 'Joah...God I hate you.' As if I needed anymore of that stuff.   I posted it to see whom of you would stick by me no matter what. It really seems though, now that I look at it, that Rosie was reallllllllllyyyyy eager to give up on me...some friend :), well we've got things straightened out for the most part.  Then I woke up the next morning and felt stupid because I really enjoy the outside input at times, so I went back on it but it was a little too late for that. So today in fourth I answered Lily's post for the most part(there's more answers for her and Lindsey after this one, by the way), and I resent an invitation to join the BLog since Lindsey had backed out and was mad at me.  So that is the story. Last night things were pretty good for a while. But I really don't care. Actually, at one point, Leigh Anne had this horoscope thing on her cell and was telling me to think of a question and tell her...at one of them I just said, 'Can I just keep it in my head?' and she said ok, and the real question was, 'Will things ever work out with me and her?', and the VERY astonishing answer was a bunch of star alignment bullshit followed by the interpretation, 'Give it time and it will work in the near future,'. I was like, WHOA. She asked what the question was and I was too stunned to think for a second. Then I said something about if I was going out to eat or not that day.  She always thinks of something bad when I'm making her laugh, and she bring it up, after which it'll be a thorn in my side and I really can't be humorous anymore and she'll start talking about all these guys...I swear to god, this girl has no female friends, and the ones that could be considered so, she can't connect with them, or they're lesbians and they're after her.  So that's about it for now, that's the story so far.  Fucking story.     "

We have concluded that he does not care whether the other dog is male or female:  he is still 'interested' (nice euphemism, huh?).    Like this morning, after Keisha left for school.  I took Jake for a little walk without a leash in the little cul de sac area where we live.  I'm glad I spotted the male poodle with his owner first and grabbed Jake's collar to hold on to him.  The poodle's owner mentioned that the poodle prefers male dogs to female.  I was slightly relieved to discover that Jake is not alone in his preference for dogs of the same sex.  Last Saturday we took him to my Dad's farm in Indiana, and he met Icky, short for Ichabod, who is a dog old enough to be Jake's grandfather.  Let's just say that Icky made it very clear up front that he was not interested.  It was fun to watch the two of them interact.  As Jake would get close to Icky, Icky would growl and start to chase after Jake.  Jake, the much younger and faster dog, would get away unscathed, yet with his tail between his legs nevertheless.  Then, as I walked Jake around the farm, Icky followed.  As Jake would 'mark' his spots around the farm, Icky would follow up with 'marks' of his own.  While we humans were chatting, Jake and Icky would take turns marking the firewood pile, for example.  Silly dog.         ",

The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the 'local group' of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.         ",

I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and 'we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?'  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...         ",

      "1": "           JLS: in regards to the protests against Bush's visit to England, you said:    'A shame that 200,000 people organized themselves only to express anger.  Such honest effort and energy expended to no end other than brief catharsis.'   Nick responded to your conclusions.  What did you think of his response?  Do you agree with his take on the protest?    OK, on to the 'Bush unwelcome'. I take the point that a Stop the War protest seems a little pointless about a war that's over, but a) it's not like we were protesting the Boer War or something; there's still shooting and air bombardment going on in Iraq; and b) that wasn't the point of the march anyway.   It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.

I blame the majority of this on Scott, who slightly misconstrues all situations because HE HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CLUE WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT.  He never sees Abby, yet is constantly downing her, and taking you to his level of thinking.  Abby is epitomy of nice and just and fair and anything else that you could ever compliment her with.  Scott is jealous because Josh got Abby and he didn't.  I'm with Josh in that you're really reading a LOT into the situation.  If you'll notice, Abby never got mad.  She barely even showed annoyance.  I'm viewing this as your taking advantage of a minor infraction so that you can blow up at her, which you do not have the right to do.  Josh is most definitely justified in siding with her.  He loves her, she loves him.  Their relationship is not something you see every day.  That in itself justifies him siding with her, and I fully support that.  Abby has nothing on which to base a hate of you, and frankly I think that you're being a bit paranoid and slightly arrogant to think that she hates you.  She's met you for maybe five minutes?  Talked directly to you on the blog maybe thrice?  I know Abby than almost anyone else on this planet, and let me assure you that I know exactly who she does and does not hate.  Does she hate you?  No.  Does she like you?  No.  She has no information.  She has no need to like or dislike you.  The only thing she knows about you is that you have insulted me, and that will be held against you until she dies, most likely.  Other than that, she is, for the most part, completely apathetic about your entire existence.  You really don't have a great impact on her life, like it or not.  And continuing on what Josh said, you stick a knife in his back, you stick a knife in Abby's, and by doing so stick a knife in mine.  And it's me that's going to be pissed in the end, because Abby freakin' saved my life in 9th grade.  I owe her everything in my possession and more, and I will pay that debt if it's the last thing I do, by protecting her happiness and well-being, and that of everyone she loves.  And if you [that being a general you, not directed at you specifically] get in the way of that happiness, then by God if I don't absolutely rip you to shreds.  Josh, I apologize for saying to tone it down.  Perhaps you should stay at your own level.  I forgot for a second that this was Abby we're talking about.  You were provoked and you are justified in your comment.    This should be my last post on this topic.  I hope.  Cause I hate being angry.    "

Within the last 48 hours, Keisha has gotten earaches - one for each ear.  She has not been wearing her hearing aids, naturally, so we've been using sign language to communicate with her where needed.  We've wondered whether this is related to her getting her 6-year molars, since she describes pain from the back of her jaw to her ear, as though her 6-year molars were coming in.  Friday night we took her to Urgent Care at Children's Medical Center here in Dayton, and the doctor confirmed that she had an ear infection in her left ear.  Saturday morning Jennie took her to the pediatrician, who diagnosed an ear infection in the right ear as well.  When the pain is present, it exists as a constant hurting, and all she can do is moan in agony.  Fortunately we have her on Children's Tylenol and Motrin, along with the antibiotic Cefzil (insert respective trademarks where applicable).  She just isn't her normal self.  Jennie and I, in a way, appreciate times like these, in which we get to care for our lovely 5-1/2 year old baby girl, yet we also hurt, seeing her in pain.  I can personally relate to the pain that Keisha feels.  From the time I was born until I was about 7 years old, I would get ear infections at least once a year.  My most vivid memory is lying on the couch while my other siblings were around - Mom, too - moaning in agony because the pain was so acute, as I waited for my stepfather to return from the pharmacy with my medicine.  Yet there is someone else who can most definitely relate with the pain Keisha feels: Jesus Christ.  And God the Father can most definitely relate with the hurt I feel for Keisha.  God the Father watched his One and Only child suffer and die.  I praise you, Heavenly Father, for helping me to know you so much better as a result of the present situation with Keisha.  So Jennie and I are doing 'round-robin' duty tonight, which means that, as Keisha wakes up, we'll alternatively meet her needs.  I am so grateful to have a Father in Heaven who doesn't need sleep and who provides strength and peace.  He watches over us while we sleep.  It makes me wonder what he thinks about...         ",

Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            ",

But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly.

Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.

He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",

Rosie has backed off on her anti-Michael campaign, and if her reaction (to basically nothing) seems overworked, it's probably not you, it's probably something else.  so... if that covers it all, go back to you lives citizens  PS Rosie, if you really feel the need to get mad at someone, why don't you get mad at someone you communicate better with.

That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.  Given the past effectiveness of their terroristic activities, they will try them again, seeing weakness.  As with most things, there are no simple answers, and I have no grandiose ideas.

More reason why we should reduce the size of government:   Everyone who has ever bought a house can enjoy this.. (or dealt with bureaucrats)  A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Admin) loan for a client.  He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.  After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following  reply (actual letter): 'Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803.  Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.' Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter): 'Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received.  I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application.  I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application.    For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain.  The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella.  The good queen, Isabella, being pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus' expedition.  Now the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is [considered by many at the time to be] the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana.  God, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back, to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it AND the FHA.  I hope the hell you find God's original claim to be satisfactory.  Now, may we have our damn loan?' The loan was approved.         ",

I know we all wish she were here to celebrate with together. However take a minute to pause and just thank her for the contribution she made to your life personally.  I think that would be a great way to honor her today.  I think of all you daily and with much love, Margie  My grandma, Loraine Mitchell, died when I was in kindgergarten (1975).  The only thing I remember about it was when my Mom took me back to school.  She told my teacher that if I looked like I was feeling down, it was probably because of Grandma's funeral.  I don't remember a whole lot about my grandma.  I remember that Steph(my sister) and I would visit her and Gramps at their home at 52 Graham Street in Cincinnati.  She would make us 'brown cows' and 'pink cows' (drinks made with ice cream and either root beer or cream soda, respectively).  I also remember that she showed us how to make a flower using some facial tissue, a pipe cleaner, and a little spritz of cologne.  We would fold the tissue alternatively, like you would to make a fan.  Then we would wrap an end of the pipe cleaner around the middle of the folded tissue.  After that we would carefully peel the tissue up on both sides to create the petals of the flower.  Then we'd spray a small amount of cologne to give our flower a scent.  I vaguely remember she called me 'Little Bit.'  It turns out that she was petite herself, not much taller than 59 inches.  I see a lot of her facial features in my aunts and uncles, and sometimes in me.  She also had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which contributed to her death.  I found some posts from Mom's blog about it from the April 2003, when Mom had an echo cardiogram done:    Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy Project   Mom's personal reflection on   being with her mother (my grandma) during her last days   I encourage you all to pray for my Mom.

But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike.

      "3": "           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           ",

The grants will go to 10 community-based organizations, which will help employers and labor unions recruit, train, hire and retain women in apprenticeship and nontraditional jobs.  'This Administration is committed to helping women learn about the opportunities available and the fields of work, where long-term careers can be realized,' said Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. 'From carpentry to masonry, more and more women are putting in long hours of training or retraining, and taking pride in the fact that their work is helping to make America greater.'  The Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations grantees are: Oregon Tradeswomen, Inc., Portland, Oregon; Tradeswomen, Inc., Oakland, California; Women in Non-Traditional Employment Roles, Long Beach, California; Nontraditional Employment for Women, New York, New York; Women's Resource Center, Grand Rapids, Michigan; Montana Job Training Partnership, Helena, Montana; HRC, Inc., Wasilla, Alaska; Northern New England Tradeswomen, Inc., Essex Junction, Vermont; Chicago Women in Trades, Chicago, Illinois; and Area Resources for Community and Human Services, St. Louis, Missouri.  The Women's Bureau administers the grants with the Labor Department's Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services.

The meeting conveyed a lot of important stuff for us parents, but there were a couple of times when Keisha turned to me and said, 'Are they almost done?'  Then, after the meeting adjourned the kids went to their chairs and sat down.  I went to Keisha and said, 'I'm going to go now, and Ms. Fabian will take care of you.

It's interesting that they are getting better, since I've haven't recorded since finishing the last song of the 'really bad demo'...just been reading on it a lot and thinking of how stuff could sound really cool if I went just a bit overboard.  That would explain why I used about four different mics on one acoustic, and two on an amplifier (that's not so bad). But it sounds really good for an early cut...I'd go so far as to say, some of the better sonics I've ever done.  Woot!

As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          ",

Franklin pulled some shit in nine seconds. Everyone around me was saying, 'Hell no, Franklin will never do it.'   They missed the extra point, we got the ball first in OT. We were killed in the field goal, and then they kicked one and got it...their very first one of the night.  Everyone was clearly defined, teamwise, after the game. I was the one standing way up top giving Franklin the bird.   On the way out tho...I had calmed a bit. I was still fucking pissed off...hell, I still am. But I was cooling down, driving by the buses, giving the Franklin bandies the 'evil eye', which they returned and being pretty amicable, in general. And then, one of the buses starts up the chant, 'Bend over, Brentwood.'  Fuck, I dunno why, but that was the shortest straw. I think it's just the fact that they're a bunch of redneck assholes. Maybe some latent fear of being anally raped?!? But all the same, the window was down, and I made clear my feelings on that with a mid-based finger. Someone yelled, 'Franklin rules!' to which I yelled...something not very nice. I made up a lot of things too. I must give myself one thing, if not a lot of things: I am a proficient swearer. Tonite became the advent of so many interesting phrases, I could do verbal battle with a sailor and pwn his @zz.  So. I'm going to bed. Today was a really bad frickin' day, because it was raining.

David Stanley also made some pretty fucking horrible comments today about Abby...I'm playing football at his house on Monday. Rest assured he's going to fucking  die . I don't care if he's not being serious. There was a line, and he crossed it. And that was just further depressing, and more than just a bit angering.

After sitting there playing the wonderful song about a thousand times in a row, I believe we have finally come to be a musical power, a force uncontained. I believe we are fully ready...I can hear Alex constantly insisting on our talent show dominance. I've been over here since after school Friday, think of nothing but this song, perhaps slacking off for long periods of time, but nevertheless, my brain is in these notes, my thoughts are in my voice screaming into that microphone decorated with a black ribbon and Rosie's bracelet, surrounded by a thin veil of the unused yellow duct tape from the DI competition. Everywhere I step there is rubber or metal, everything smells like machine or burning or oil or something to that effect, the smell of mechanization, the scent of our music, I suppose. It's invigorating, actually.  And after so much hard work, there is still so much to go wrong. Tyler goes to Georgia tomorrow, what if he becomes stuck there? What if I cannot pull off a prerecorded bass track before the time? My amp permanently shorted out today, so we're taking the Marshall...supposing, in getting it, we take too long and show up too late? We have up to 4:40 to show up, which means we must be gods in our speed, o Hermes, I invoke ye. Whatifwhatifwhatif...I think too much. Chances are things are going to go off without too much of a hitch and we either fail to get in or go for the glory. Sort of scared, I've too much confidence that we're going to make it...I have a lot of faith in this song, I always have. And now...  God, preserve me. I have so much on my mind.  Yesterday my dad came over, I decided to dump the woes of my agony at our finding Tyler inept. That was about the point I started screaming every obscenity I have ever known for the entire world. At the top of my lungs, with Alex and Tyler and my dad standing close at hand laughing. And after, so did I. And then, I foolishly accepted a shot of chocolate liquer and passed out drunk at about 11 last night.  No  alcohol tolerance. But that's besides the point. I was screaming as loud as I could, exactly the words  no one  wants to hear, and I have never ever felt better.  And this weekend, I have been more tired than I have ever been in my entire life. So much work...so much, and for what? To win? I don't think that's what I've been after all this time. I think it was all just to prove that I could do it, to get up on stage and stare down a hard-ass crowd. To prove myself. To prove to even myself that I can do it. And winning is simply an extremely necessary byproduct. To feel that adrenaline rush. To take in the crowd and make them mine. Basically, to feel that selfish and piggish desire that I'm better than everyone else because  I have a band and I wrote a song and I sing and play guitar, not the best, but shit  you can't do it  .  And that's what I feel like right now. Everything else is forgotten. Were you to call me right now, anything you would say would be answered by a line from  My Solution . 'Hello, Josh?''BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE STONE COLD FLOOR,''What?''Asylum  was  the answer,''What the hell are you talking about?''That I break free from this cage,'  Someone help me. Heheh, a pleasureful pain.    Nitokris nitokris . I dunno.     "

'Hey, you!  Go for this and go for that.'  It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes.  Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done.  Here's some advice:   Desired Results.  Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it.  Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it.  Guidelines.  Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate.  Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do.  Resources.  Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them.  Accountability.  Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur.  Consequences.  Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!    ",

Well...to make a long story less long...after the pageant we had a little mini-concert in my garage with another band called Stutter. We played our set (sucked more or less) and then Stutter got on and played one song. The parentals knocked on the door to inform us that we were being shut down...simultaneously two cop cruisers pulled up. The cop got out and made some remarks on my makeup (but was being really cool about it), asked if there was any drinking (no). J.H. brought a Gene Simmons mask and the cop asked if we had all gone to the show when KISS came here, a chorus of yeses and nos. He asked who was playing Money on the bass a couple of minutes ago, and said that Pink Floyd destroys all. Keep that mask in mind, by the way.  So, here I am in a mild state of confusion, feeling pretty tired and suddenly I see Gaddis jerk around in the garage (I was a little outside) and put his finger to his lips. I listened and heard someone playing the drums. The door from inside flew open and out comes my mom hissing that the cops are right there in the front yard. I ran inside and yelled, 'Moron, the cops are looking right at you!' And the IRONY: it was a  cop  playing the drums! He asked one of the guys how to do a roll, and he was really good at it. Then, part two: the first cop to come in asks if he can wear the mask. Scrambles to get a camera. My mom got a camcorder.  The drumming cop gave us a little speech about how he can only ask us to stop but he can't enforce it because Williamson has no noise ordinances. He asks, 'Ready?' We shout our approval, the one cop, now fully masked, and the other cop who just gave the speech, turn to face the camera with Gene Simmons tongues a-loll and devil horns straight at the lens. Needless to say, the aftermath was armageddoneous roaring...I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Then they bid us a good'n and left.  The video is absolutely amazing, I'll have to show everyone.   Alright self, breathe!       "

SO I call him Tuesday to tell him that Linds's mom is ok and that he better call me or A.I'm going to think he's dead or B. He just accidently forgot that he's supposed to be planning this get together...either way he's already in trouble. I'm not patient...well not alot and it didn't help that I had Jessica going in the other ear 'When are we meeting, Where, What day, What time again?' it sucked. Anyway I finally got to him today and it turns out the kid has been in bed sick...it was just too funny... he was to plan something for the first time and he gets sick...of course I was the friend that laughed but wished him to get well soon....AND he's got to get well to go to our summer camp Undone (with our church)(I'll be in on of the 8 colleges I chose to see) and CentreKid to be a helper....he's gotta get well FAST...so he basicalliy chose the worst week to be sick and it was FUNNY.

    "query_text": "           john: ok, i'm going to pick on you now.  i'm sure you're worried.  :)   concerning the legality of burning the american flag, you said:  ' Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off. However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

Social/Emotional:   Call a friend you haven't seen in a while, volunteer time to charity, or do something nice for someone--anonymously.   Mental:   Visit a library or museum, solve a brainteaser, puzzle or riddle, or watch an educational show on TV.

Little did we remember, and my grandmother  did , that we are in the middle of a 'fear terrorism' mentality and people have bought all duck tape and plastic with which to secure windows against the threat of viral warfare.  People, if the germ wants in, it'll  get  in, don't worry your poor, illogical, and incoherent heads.  With the two rolls given to me by my grandmother, and the one I found at the store while stocking up on  my  antiterroristic formula, caffeine, it gives us a grand total of SCREWED. The ones given me are strange...one is huge and yellow, while the other roll is...dirty. It has particles all over it.  Most likely, however, we have enough.  I woke to my  sister's  alarm clock, who, by the way, isn't at this house this weekend.  It's Getting Hot In Herre , the slut anthem of the new millenium, blasting through her open door, the new cat, Camille, scratching on mine. I was frankly overwhemled by this chaos...bombs really are louder in the morning, especially to teenage boys who  sleep . I rolled out of bed, scratching my frazzled scalp and rubbing the sleep for my eyes as I headed to the pandemonium out there, the Leviathan of noise called Nelly.   After five minutes of experimenting on how to turn off the alarm clock in the dark, and achieving my goal (worse, it happened to be my old one), I walked to the shower as slowly as possible, dreading the dire results of it ending. So, using your powers of deduction, one could ascertain that this shower consumed a quantity no less than that of the Nile's daily flow of water for five thousand years. As it ended the anxiety of which I spoke settled in on my shoulders and started shaking me, choking my being to mutate into a child of his disorder. Staving him is getting sufficiently harder with every glance at the clock, and seeing as how computer have said wonderful device  somewhere  on every screen, his iced grip colds my being with the seconds that wake.  The tick, tick, the incessance of the clock begins to drive me to chaotica, a state of complete euphoric insanity, humanity enveloped with the penchant to destroy in a mad and fearful wake. The tick is louded now, slower, it multiplies and divides faster than its amoebic kin (or is becoming as such at this point), I see my fingers smashing the keys at tremendous speeds, letting the blood from each repeated strike dance upon my lined, tired visage, my heart quickens, my brain begins thinking sans rationality, but with much in speed that the normal self would desire.  The world commences spinning out of control, the clocks are a wall of noise, my heart, on the verge of imploding on itself with its unending repetetions, the bag, once full of chips, both cheesed and plain, now on my head, suffocating my burning lungs, and the suffocation is a release from the madness, but soon becomes another twisted limb of its endless desire to give birth  again  to, to whelp  again , to create one new life in the masses of a sentient being   again  .   >   a<>> >>>i<>>>  F A L L S  into oblivion and their is much of stark contrast between the constantcy of fixed human shape and his now boiling thoughts. He is on the verge of  ! ! EXpl.......od###ing into pieces, or at least he feels as such, the strength accrued over the course of his now shortened 15 years drained and sucked dry in a matter of seconds, the vampire(DOTH STOCK YE) consumes his mind and again he  F A L L S  into darkness this time, and he feels the warmth of EUPHORIA, in nomine, ave euphoria, carry me away on your lusty back, your thoughts intuned to naught but contentment, the soul waits in purgation as the body, soulless but with none to control its spirit but nature  UNL EASH ES?  a veritable  Gotterdammerung  upon the nations of earth, moreover upon his house, now being pummeled by unquenched human REWOPpower as it consumes his form, even death is an illusion, even death is a puppet deathisminedeath is my lovesheismy lover and i am the king and OBLIVION is my servant and suddenly  I realize, it was from drinking caffeine this early in the morning. I pick up the fallen bag and throw the can in the sink, where it, like everything on the planet, will be washed and recycled in time. Nature prevails once again, she replenishes both herself and the spirit of those upon her. And for me, rationality has prevailed once again.  I, with rushing spirit and unconquerable indomitablity, and a MAJOR surge of caffeine, forth into the unknown, I ride the winds of creation into a new age, one of competetion not of feats of strength and show, but of the minds, where thought is the strongest weapon, and thoughts gauge themselves in power with each mind. Together, they are weapons of feared power, or they are unstable, as atoms, fickle bonds apt to split in seconds.  I feel the warm coils of my mentality slide back into place. Now with the surging thoughts and enforced spirit  I am  invincible .    "

'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         ",

Schools were closed for awhile.  I remember that we'd get a bunch of homework when we went to class in case schools had to be closed again for awhile.  I went to   Greener Elementary .  I believe I was in the second grade.   Keego Harbor, Michigan   In the spring and fall of 1990, as well as the spring of 1991, I co-oped for a company in the Greater Detroit area.  I stayed with a coworker, paying him room and board.  He had a house in   Keego Harbor , which is situated next to   Cass Lake .  I remember the A&P Supermarket, just down the street.  Some of the best moments were spending time at night on the pier, overlooking the lake and seeing the stars.  There were a couple times, I believe that I went sailing.  I had never sailed before, and the craft we used was not that big, if I remember correctly.  I decided not to go back out sailing, once I found out that in some places the lake was over 90 feet deep.  I have a terrible fear of large bodies of water to begin with, thanks I suppose to movies like '  Jaws '.   Sharon Keys   I had a huge crush on her in fifth grade.

The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           ",

I did go to Driver's  Edge , which was just a 'rough road situations' class...but like hell if they'll get me into a Driver's Ed class :) I'm not sure if I understood the next question...to get your  driver's  license, with which you would operate a car  alone  (and yes, permit and license sometimes get confused, so I just had to put this little segment in), and if you're under 21, which you are :), but at or above 16...you need to have held a permit for  six months  and driven for something like 100 hours or so, and then you can get your license. Alls Driver's Ed does is put some slack on your insurance, which, for a teen driver, is a much less than savoury number. To do the tests to get your permit/license, you need to go to the licenseing station in Franklin, which is on Old Mill Road off of I-96, it's after a little park and is very hard to miss.  Now...if you haven't held a permit yet...then you can't get your license, obviously...unless you actually want to wait until you're 21, whereafter you can just do the road test and get your license, if my memory serves me. The permit test is strictly written and eye exam, whereas the license test is strictly road and eye.  Once you've taken the written exam, you never have to take it again . WOOWOO! And then there's the road exam, which is strictly driving...just don't get the one-armed man, he's sorta anal and pissed off at life, I believe. Mostly because he's an underpaid state employee and he has one arm. I sympathize with that man, despite the fact that he marked me off for two............... LITTLE ........................things.

The other goes to a family in Spain; they name him  'Juan.' Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself  to his mom.

We leave on Sunday, and get on the cruise on Monday.  The father hath spoken, however, and apparently, the only way I will be traveling (other than car and airplane) is by wheelchair.  Yay.  One of those, as my little sister so graciously pointed out, has one of those ten foot tall flags on it.

But on a good note, I am leaving here in a few minutes to get a manicure and pedicure.  I hate going though, because the people will only talk in Vietnamese, and then they laugh, and I think they have to be talking about me, because otherwise, why would they have to speak Vietnamese.  Next time, I think I'll take Josh, so he can tell me if they say 'doll' or 'uncle.'  Um, also, I bought 3 new pairs of shoes.  YAY!!!!

They have this little buckle type thing on the top.  They are so adorable.  And they all have really cute heels, but none of them are that tall.  Ok, sorry for boring you, guys.  Oh, my puppy is being so cute.  We got mulch delivered today so that William can put it out sometime this weekend, and she's trying to climb it, but she's not succeeding.

      "2": "           Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so. The government wants to bury the truth but I can tell you what's real. The Earthlings are going to invade and the government is spending our hard earned tax dollars on press releases and denials instead of preparing for the battle to come.'   A spokesthing denied any government involvement in the disappearance of Rhodo, who has not been seen since shortly after the interview, claiming 'Any sentient being knows that a planet with the concentrations of water and oxygen found on Earth is a deadly and inhospitable environment for the formation of life, much less intelligent life. The fear and consternation caused by the unfounded and wild speculations of citizens like Rhodo are a traitorous disservice to the citizens of Mars.'           ",

He talks a lot about the Jobs and Growth Act of 2003, which he recently signed into law: ... Next week, the United States Treasury will begin printing and mailing more than 25 million child tax credit checks, putting over $12 billion back into the hands of American families. These rebates are the result of the Jobs and Growth Act I recently signed into law, which increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child. And because this new law reduced income tax rates, businesses earlier this month lowered tax withholding for worker paychecks. Now, those workers and their families have a lighter tax bill and more take-home pay...  ... My administration remains focused on faster economic growth that will translate into more jobs. Now that Americans can keep more of what they earn, we can expect to see rising demand for goods and services. And as demand increases, companies will need more workers to meet it...  ... Government does not create prosperity. Government can, however, create the conditions that make prosperity possible. The Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 was based on the fundamental faith in the energy and creativity of the American people. With hard work and daily determination, entrepreneurs and workers are moving this economy forward. The American economy is headed in the right direction, and we can be confident of better days ahead.     ",

      "4": "       Let me tell you a little story about a man called Stability.  Well, not really. But the key word here is 'stability.' Embrace constancy, it's the nepethe for the human condition. Think about your body: it wants homeostasis, a point of norm. If you keep messing with your environment and deciding to change too much (or thinking you can, which is worse), no matter how good the control feels right now, if it's real or not, you're going to wear yourself out.  And moreover (and more importantly; no offense, but I  am  a suicide kid), it's wearing  me  out. Honestly, pick a path and stick to it. Remember what happened to the kid who wandered too far off the path because he thought he could come back without any problems: messily devoured by wolves and then peed on. I don't think, dead or alive, I would much like to have something urinating on me, would you?  This really has gone on long enough, all of you. You win, stop the guilt. It's either him or her, it's not both. Sometimes we get denied an option because not everyone thinks alike. That is NOT within the scope of your control. If Becca is going to be depressed and guilt's flying all over the place, I'm sorry. But that's nothing you can feasibly control. This may sound like an asshole thing to say, but think about it: even if you say, 'Fuck off Philip, you gay!' it's still not going to make him like Becca, and you're not going to have him either. What more, she's going to think you broke up with him out of pity for her, and she's STILL not going to like you (and if Becca's reading this, aren't I right?!) because she's going to see it. Something has to get lost, it's called acceptable casualties. I wish just as much as you do that the world was colored pebbles and bunnies and lilies singing in the field, but since it isn't, we have to make the best out of a shit situation and forget about the rest. Things don't come back to haunt you if you don't let them.  It's our fear of the past that creates the problems of the future.  WRITE THAT DOWN ON YOUR LIFE. I think I'm even going to post that on all of the blogs and my Xanga for the hell of it. That was damned insightful, and true, what more.  But really, make a decision and stick to it. The more you doubt yourself, the more indecision you have, the more nothing gets done, the more you just hurt the situation til you don't have a choice anymore like you do now, get me? I really hope you read all this, really.  IF YOU JUST SCROLLED THROUGH, ROSIE:  READ ALL OF THIS RIGHT NOW, TIS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. AFTER THIS PART, YOU CAN QUIT.   Alright, on to me :) I'm fucked up on trileptol. This shit is killing me. I'm a fucking walking zombie with some hot looking Chucks on. I swear, my head hasn't spun this much since the last time I stuck my head in a dryer...which has been...oh, let's see...never, right. I seriously want to blow up. I hate fucking being a bipolar, it sucks a fucking nut. I'm really really super-fucking manic about now. It makes me ultra-insightful and fun, but I really fucking hate it. I say fuck a lot, people tend to like me less sometimes when they say something that could be taken the slightest bit offensively. I seriously can't type 'seriously,' or anything on the first try, for that matter. And the worst part of it is: I'm out the fuck of fucking options. I have ONE LEFT: lithium carbonate, and that requires me to go stay in the FUCKING UNIT  AGAIN ! Fuck me! Like hell they'll take me back! AAAAGGH! I'm going to explode. I haven't had a moodswing like this since Linds...actually, this is worse than that. I really feel like my heart is about to start pumping so hard it's going to come out of my mouth, but that I'll enjoy it when it happens. I know, all of this sounds weird, none of you will understand what the fuck is going on, but that's alright. I would actually prefer if you didn't say anything about it. I can't explain it right now that you could.  It's just a whole hell of a lot of crazy energy waiting to come out. My heart is a caffeine factory and my brain is an amphetamined, angel dusted foreman. I'm the bipolar I king of the whole fucking universe. Yes, I typed bipolar  ONE . Something crazy is happening right now. I keep thinking about Picasso, the way he cut off his ear during mania. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't. Actually, I've learned enough to not be so crazy as to act on any of my shit ideas I get when I'm manic, but I really think some crazy shit sometimes when it's happening. It's all here. Don't expect any of the things I say here to happen, I'm smarter than that (and no smart-ass comments to that, or I'll eat you).   It sucks because I know that very very soon, I'm going to come down and bomb the fuck out, I'm probably going to get so depressed I won't know what to do with myself except sleep and think about nothing. That's what I do these days when I'm depressed: concentrate on abso-fucking-loutely nothing. It helps. It doesn't tangle my depressed stuff with my good stuff, it's not worth it trying to cheer myself up during depression, it's not that simple, and it doesn't work, so fuck it. I plan to keep my good memories in tact for mania and baseline so that there there in whole form and ready to be used as they should be, not as death-traps waiting to bring me down (although sometimes, as in now, they could be useful).  I think I just felt myself beginning to drop. You can't run a car forever without it stalling out and coming to a complete stop. I puff the last of my psychic gasoline and come to a screeching hault wrapped around a telephone poll but quite alive, just bleeding. Every time. What a feeling it is. That's the best description I could give, the best yet. I give on this post. It made me feel better, it filled the last half-hour quite well. If you actually read all this, I'm having your children, come to Unca Josh's right now. Peace out, y'all mega wonderous pals o' mine.    "

Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.                  ",

      "0": "              JENNIE   Jennie has been feeling really depressed.  I guess you could say that she's been that way for quite some time.  Other emotions: anger, resentment, frustration.  I've felt these same feelings and have often shared them here.  Yesterday morning she came home from work in time to head back out to an appointment.  I later saw her when she came into the restaurant where I work.  By the time I arrived home (circa 4:15 PM), she hadn't gone to bed yet.  She had a lot on her mind, and I let her talk.  Then I got a little scared when she said she was having suicidal thoughts.  Whereas I use self-injury to cope, she uses food, namely sugar.  I'd been urging her to call the Crisis Care hotline so that she could speak with someone, and even get help for her depression, etc.  Finally, I called the number and handed the phone to her.  She talked with a woman on the phone for some time.  This woman asked if she wanted to go to their office last night; Jennie said she was feeling like she'd be okay just to go in tomorrow (this morning).  So she made an appointment for 10 AM.  I remember, two years ago, when my mom first moved up here, that my mom wound up in the hospital for a week.  I really hope that isn't necessary for Jennie, although I have to consider the possibility.  I feel sad and a little worried for my wife.  She is the love of my life, and I want her to feel better.  I've seen her pull back from God so much over these past couple of years.  I've encouraged her to draw near to him, thinking that, maybe he's allowing all the things that are going on to happen so that she will turn back to him.  'What if God is allowing all this to happen to humble you?' I inquired gently.  She has expressed that she feels it's useless to pray.  It's as though doing all the spiritual things like praying, studying the Bible, meeting with others, are not working.  I know I've felt that way at times myself.  I told her that I was committed to being there for her no matter what.  When we got married, I sang Steven Curtis Chapman's song 'I Will Be Here' to her as part of my wedding vows.  I told her that I Will Be Here no matter what happens.  I need to be careful of using pat phrases like that, however.  Because they can and have been overused, in time they seem to lose their meaning.  It's a little bit like singing the same songs again and again at church; after awhile we get so used to the words that we stop meditating on their meaning.    KEISHA   Keisha has also had a tough week.  Her school is conducting Terra Nova testing, which is supposed to give an idea of how kids might perform on future standardized tests.  I guess it also may indicate where the school can improve in their instruction, etc.  She loves to read, which fires Jennie and I up to no end.  It's becoming so common for her to pick up a picture book we get from the library and read it out loud to us.  Some of the multi-syllable words I help her sound out.  Then after she's read it to me, I sometimes review it with her to verify she understood what the story was about.  I love going to the library to pick out books for her.  Because I want reading to be fun and the time we read together to be fun, I've opted for Humor books.  Our library places a humor sticker on those books deemed as such, which makes them easy to spot.  Keisha also loves to draw.  It's evident in that her default activity is to grab some paper and some crayons, markers, etc. and start drawing.  But math appears to be a bit more difficult.  Perhaps it's because it can be rather abstract to see numbers on a page and not be able to instinctively see their meanings.  I try to think back to when I was learning addition and subtraction and how I was.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember.  She also gets easily frustrated when she's not picking the information up.  I'm challenged by this because I can be the same way.  I also have to be careful not to get impatient with her and be sure to encourage her.  There were some particular problems she had for homework that were bothering her.  I finally had the idea to use pennies out of her bank as visual aids.  That seemed to help.  What helped even more, according to Keisha, was that I was there to help her.  I'm not a psychiatrist and I know I'm not qualified to diagnose my daughter, but, as someone with ADHD, I can say that I see some signs of it with her.  As I would talk with her about her homework, she would play with her pencil and eraser - distracted.  I found that frustrating because I felt that she wasn't paying attention to me.   ME   I'm learning to take advantage of my day planner.  I look forward to using colors, etc. to make appointments, etc. stand out.  (I realize that this might sound a bit strange to you all.)  If I can make my organization system fun, colorful, and interesting, then I think I'll have a good chance of keeping up with it.  I would love to have a coach; someone to help keep me on track, etc.  I'm learning to use timers: for example, the kitchen timer has gone off four times since I began this post to remind me that I need to leave for work.  My watch alarm has a 'snooze button' effect in which it sounds five minutes after I touch the particular button.  I use that to remind me that I need to take my medicine and when I need to get ready to leave work, among other things.  I'm using other alarm clocks, too.  I hope that eventually stuff like this will become second nature to me and help me be more effective.  There is so much more that I could probably talk about - I need to talk about - but I need to go for now.  (like we found out yesterday that our Transitional Medicaid expires at the end of this month for Jennie and I.  This means we'll have no insurance. Ugh!)  Pray for us.         ",

For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.

Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.

    "query_text": "                 Here's something sure to liven your day.    AN ANGRY LETTER FROM ENGLAND Actual British complaint letter. The piece  suggests two things    1) Americans and Canadians are not the only ones who get poor service from  their ISP, cable and/or alarm companies. (NTL is a cable operator in  Britain).    2) The Brits probably write the world's best letters of complaint.    ====================================    Dear Cretins    I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your  four-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, telephone, and alarm  monitoring.    During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service  which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and  stupidity of monolithic proportions. Please allow me to provide specific  details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative and  seek to rectify these difficulties -- or more likely (I suspect) so that  you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the  working day smoking B&H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your  office.    My initial installation was cancelled without warning, resulting in my  spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your  technician to arrive. When he did not arrive, I spent a further 57 minutes  listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying  Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website. HOW?    I alleviated the boredom by playing with my testicles for a few minutes --  an activity at which YOU are no doubt both familiar and highly adept. The  rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although  the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools -- such as a  drill-bit and his cerebrum. Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not  arrived. After 15 telephone calls over four weeks my modem arrived, six  weeks after I had requested it -- and begun to pay for it. I estimate your  internet server's downtime is roughly 35% -- the hours between about 6 pm  and midnight, Monday through Friday and most of the weekend. I am still  waiting for my telephone connection.    I have made nine calls on my mobile to your no-help line and have been  unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals who are,  it seems, also highly skilled bollock jugglers. I have been informed that  a telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will  be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is  available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone  (and then been redirected to an answering machine informing me that your  office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone and then been  redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman. And several other  variations on this theme.    Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a  thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore and also another one of  those crucially important testicle moments to attend to. Frankly I don't  care. It's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in  print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me,  therefore, if I continue.    I thought British Telecom was crap; that they had attained the holy  piss-pot of god-awful customer relations; and that no one, anywhere, ever,  could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to  delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NT and because,  well, there isn't anyone else is there?    How surprised I therefore was when I discovered to my considerable  dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you  truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum, incompetents  of the highest order. BT -- wankers though they are -- shine like  brilliant beacons of success in the filthy mire of your seemingly  limitless inadequacy.    Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest  to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you cease any  potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which  you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver. Any such  activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief and will  quickly be replaced by derision and even perhaps bemused rage.    I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cat's  litter tray, as an _expression of my utter and complete contempt for both  you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become  desiccated during transit -- they were satisfyingly moist at the time of  posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not  experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the  very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL and its worthless employees.    Have a nice day. May it be the last in your miserable short lives, you  irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twits.              May you rot in Hell, Robert Stokes        ",

    "query_text": "       This is an account of my last night, as told by myself, who would be the greatest source of knowledge on such a subject:  The car ride home was a four year old talking to his mother. My chatter was incessant, the fever of 'hurdle-jumping', finally facing a long awaited day of judgment, still burning in my head. On and on about our performance, what we had done, what was truly brilliant, what I had done, every aspect of our victory, our miraculous performance; strangely nothing of the Instant Challenge past 'it was impossible but we made it', thus securing my vow of secrecy.  And the ride ran on for what seemed like not long enough, there was still far more to tell about, a thousand thousand wonders not yet embarked upon rolling about my tongue, and I langoured to spit them all out and watch them dance about and to let everyone share my joy at felling the giant. However, considering that I would be zoned for Centennial had I not been cheating the Board, as I will be until the end of this year when they change the state to open-zoning, the ride was  ultimately  abrupt. A few miles straight down the road and I was home, still talking about 'going to state' or 'yeah, well the 'TT' on my back means...'. I unlocked the door and burst inside, positively throwing myself at my two dogs anxiously awaiting their mother, and were not in the least disappointed at this surprising spasm of attention. After a minute of this, and calming mine and my mother's laughter, I stood up and went to the computer and typed several posts of our victory on the various BLogs to which I am subscribed that were appropriate as for such.   And then it all went down. The facade of energy and motivation for the day, the quick mind, the supple wit, the burning spirit, the mind intuned to one goal, all sank back into the dark places of my mentality and I was a common, fifteen-year-old boy again. Caffeine became a dull and worthless substance, I had just finished a Coke, and even after this and the one before I succumbed to sleep, I was  tired . I also gained a massive hunger, as the adrenaline faded into weariness and human need, as the 'Id' took over, and I devoured some leftovers in the fridge, possibly faster than I have ever eaten, even in down times after Taekwondo tournaments when I was younger, and once I had believed that those were the most nerve-wracking feats I had ever undertaken.  I talked to my mother for a while as the both of us watched TV, a absolutely lurid show about mortuary school on Discovery or TLC, and remembered a song that I had not quite forgotten that morning, one which stuck in my head as I woke, one that abbated the primal urges to howl in fear and aprrehension, as a caged dog in a place of foul scents. I remembered that I had been singing what I knew of that song to myself and it made me stronger, somehow, a great wall against the deluge of Noah and his ark.   ' I remember you...do you remember me too?...'Cuz I would give everything that I own, give you the skin and this flesh and these bones, the sun, the moon, the earth and sky, I never even stopped to wonder why... '  And I had a great desire to find that song and the words and learn it and play it and sing it to myself, because for just a few hours, the song had  inspired  me to do great things, and not even in physical manifest, but things inside myself that surprised even me. Things that made me sit and the awards ceremony last night and wonder, ' How? This isn't like me .'  It took two hours, because the lyrics are a bit trite, and the internet is full of scamming fools and false promises and broken things long forgotten. When I did find it I nearly shouted, in fact I believe I did. The song is, of course, called  Everything , and the artist, which I somehow knew as I typed the words into the last search box of the night, is Lit. I ran up the stairs and sang to the chordings (which were simple enough for me to pick out in a literal fifteen seconds) until my fretboard fingers began to redden with blood. I put the guitar down and set to reading. Then the world rocked me a hazy blow. I felt the dark circles under my eyes and the emptied will, and, nearly throwing the book down, I slept.   Awake . A small needle pushed its way into my arm. I sprang into wakeness in an instant at my attacker, and again the primal survival urge kicked it, the want to be not eaten in sleep. But still, my vision swam with shadows of juxtaposing dark with dark, and the world was a stream of Stygian night, a devil's soul blackness. And then a sandpaper upon my cheek, now my lips,  scratch, scratch  it said. I knew what it was, then, I knew, but I had to turn on the light anyway, to sate my curiosity.  Camille sat on my chest with all claws bared, especially happy to have finally received recognition for her prescence. She flitted happily around for a while, and I was annoyed to be forced to content my new visitor, but I was nevertheless, forced. Cats have a strange way of demanding your attention and getting it, no matter what they do. But sleep in us all is stronger than the hand of Prime Movers Unmoved, and darkness overcame once again. This scene repeated itself multitudinously during the starlight hours, but eventually I shrugged her off to the point that her cat lusts of 'mememe' died within her, and she curled upon the bed and slept.  I woke this morning to ragged thoughts of ' If only... '...   If only I hadn't stopped Rosie from giving me the ring and went on with the skit. Better that than the alternative...which we got...   They died in my head pretty quickly. I felt like a great iron box had fallen on me from a thousand foot tower. I sat inert for a while, and after an hour I had the gumption to sit up and read for a time. I turned the page, the pain in my head subsided, I turned the page, my blurred thoughts refocused, I turned the page, I remembered the triumph over misgiving from the day before, and I was moved to grin, albeit wolfishly, or so I thought to myself. And again and again, a turn, a new sensation, until I was assaulted with the full of my humanity and stood, taking a shaky step away from the bed to the window, awed at the sunstruck horizon, the sun that had not passed my eyes for two weeks.  Later on I would be typing an earlier part of this post and looking outside. There, I saw the ground turn from it's now-common gray shade to illuminated beige and green, crab grass and the sweet, common blades that decorated the scattered pate of the planet, and I rose as if by magic toward the door, I was drifting outside, hoping that the sun would last for just another second, I saw the clouds assaulting her again, threatening to shroud that wonderful lantern of day. I threw the door open and stepped outside.  It was a world of brightness and wonder. Wonder, I wondered at the blurred sun piercing a thin veil of clouds and I was blinded, but I was rejoicing in the coming of the sun, a touch of this galaxy's organic lifeforce once again, the monkey-urges satisfied for a time, and despite the sordid drops of rain, small and wide-spread, smiting my shoulders sporadically, muffled, a  pop , and upon my still-duct-taped shoes,  plick, plick , the invisible droplets heeding the call of their master, the veiled sky, to attack the hopes of humanity, the faintest and somehow most important need, to see the sun, to see that their hope had not yet died and that the sun had not yet quit a dying age of humanity. I saw it and felt it, and somehow a part of me long dead sprang into being, as, I think, it did to us all.  It was hope.    ",

      "2": "           Oops, good point, Ben - I never said who I was. Hello, everyone, I'm Nick.  My connection is via Eva - she wickedly seduced me one stormy night in Wales and has come to the UK (my homeland) to haunt my every waking hour - and the occasional one when I'm asleep, too.  I'm a stand-up comic by trade (that's what I was doing in Wales. Eva has far less excuse.).  Don't have a website, I'm afraid, but there's a British comedy website called chortle and I'm reviewed/listed   there .  Just so as not to be completely disregarding recent topics, the situation here in the UK with regards to elections is that you can take time off work to vote - not the whole day, but half a morning or something - and your employer has to let you.  I think that only applies in general elections, though (the big ones where you're voting in a new government [actually it doesn't quite work like that here, but a full explanation would take me too far from the point]).  I don't think it applies for small, local elections - which is a shame, in a way, since those are the ones where your vote counts most and you have more of a chance to really change things. It seems to me that most of our big elections (in both countries) really only afford the public the chance to ratify elite decisions; they keep the population distanced from actual policy formation whilst providing the comforting illusion that our leaders are answerable to us.  On one level they are, of course, since we can vote them out (when we're allowed to every few years) - but really those changes are pretty cosmetic.  I think the limits of the system are shown up in the following hypothesis: Let's say you introduce mandatory voting, so that there's a 95% turnout. The elected government can claim quite a legitimacy with the mandate of a genuine majority of the population. Or it would, if not for the fact that the people are effectively coerced into making the choice. So to avoid this, a 'None of the above' option is introduced. So far, so democratic.  Now, here's the dilemma: What happens if a majority of the voting population goes with the 'None of the above' choice?  Nobody running for power can legitimately take office, since the people have expressed definitely that they don't want the candidates, but you can't just leave the government empty.  What do you do? As far as I can see the system fails at this point. The powers that be can't really allow the electorate a full and comprehensive democratic choice, since there's the risk that people might use it, and that's not really what the electoral system is for.  Of course, there's already the option of not voting, or spoiling your vote, but that's fine provided those choices don't HAVE to be interpreted as 'None of the above'.  And to be honest, often a more realistic interpretation of not voting might be, 'Mmmmm... My bed's comfy.' Oops. A bit of a rant. Did Eva warn you about my tendency to do that?  To recap: 1. Hello, everybody, nice to meet you. and 2. I read too much Chomsky.         ",

Dad would let me use his bike to ride around during the summer.  It had a bike chain lock on it.  I loved riding that bike.  My dad and stepmother would let me head off for the entire day as long as I showed up in time for dinner.  One of the things I liked doing was going to the Service Merchandise store on Colerain Avenue, across from Northgate Mall.  I loved looking at the electronics, especially the keyboards.  Well, on this particular day, I didn't lock Dad's bike up because I thought I'd only be in the store for a short time.  In typical ADHD fashion, I wound up spending at least an hour, fixated on all the stuff that was inside the store.  When I came back out to leave, the bike was gone.  I think I called home to see if June (my stepmother) would come pick me up, because I was pretty far away from home to walk.  I felt so terrible, and I knew I was going to get it from my Dad.  I went to my room and waited until he came home from work.  I didn't know what to say, except to tell him what happened.  I think I was grounded for a little while.  A few years later, still feeling a little bit guilty about the situation, I had enough money from a part-time job, and I bought two new 12-speed bikes: one for me and one for my Dad.  I gave him his bike on Father's Day, and I used mine when I went to college.  I don't remember him using it that much, though.  I think my younger brother Jason wound up using it.         ",

Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.

He finally is where he wanted to be and is finally happy for a change.  Feel free to ask anyone else in our family to send along a message to him as well he does get lonely at times and I'm sure he'd love to here from everyone.  With love,  M. That's great news!

Mir -- thank you very much for the invite, but I will have to regretfully decline as I will be in Los Angeles.  Now, Mr. Shipley:  1) Mr. McVeigh ensured a seared national psyche by getting caught -- without the pulpit of the witness stand and the magnification of the media feeding frenzy, we (Mr. and Mrs. Joe Sixpack) would never have known that a small fringe group of dissatisfied citizens feels strongly enough about the state of our nation that they would resort to such a horrific statement. Perhaps now, we can identify with the British a little better. It's always a shock to find out that someone is so dissatisfied with the status quo they react with such a base emotion as violence.  2) Christians everywhere should never, ever forget that the Bible was written by the post-Roman Empire equivalent of the white-guy-of-european-descent. If you ever want a fascinating look at politics, read up on the politics behind the formation of the New Testament. What strikes me about the whole 'in his own image' issue is what the 2000 year struggle between the teachings of Christ (love thy neighbor) and the age-old human nature (do unto your neighbor before he can do unto you) says about the image of God....  3) I disagree with you on this point -- from our comfortably 21st Century agnostic-leaning perspective, it's easy to lump everyone who wasn't a native in the Puritan camp. Religion was much stronger back then, and our Founding Fathers found it as difficult to create the institutions of our government without God's influence as we would have today building an empire sans automoblie -- it's just so pervasive that it affects everything at such a level as to be inseperable. 'But what about the separation of church and state,' you ask? The context there is the religious persecutions and bloodshed of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries brought on by the merging of head of state and head of church (see Henry VIII's creation of the Anglican church for the start of that crap!). The Founders wanted a to ensure (wisely) that religion would not be used as state policy. They could not have envisioned a nation without God. Which is why they are all turning over in their graves at the recent 'Under God' Pledge of Allegiance debacle. 4) Couldn't agree with you more on this one. Preach on, brother! 5) Mmmm-hmmm.  6) Would you consider the citizen of an empire? 7) Seems to me the only sure way to correct the media-induced self conciousness of women is to remake society as a matriarchy. Think that would do it? 8) Uh. Yeah. Words are like cool and stuff. Heh, heheh. 9) Are you offering advice to those designing AI? Seems a basic insight that would make things better for those poor saps. 10) Is that because everything is advertising, or is that because you are a crusty old CYNICAL bastard??? 11) Next to hot fudge sundae, of course.... 12) And I am grateful for your wonderful, meandering, barely relevant insights.   P.S. Need everyone's help: I can't decide between 'What's He Got?' by The Producers and 'Talk To Ya Later' by The Tubes as an example the pinnacle of the New Wave sound. Thoughts?         ",

      "0": "              My Distracted Mind   I've been having an   ADHD  moment.  I came home from work this afternoon, at about 5:45 PM and greeted my family.  I noticed that Jake, our dog, was very eager to see me.  Jennie mentioned that she hadn't taken him out since she'd been home, which was about 4 PM.  I started to change my clothes, and I got as far as taking my work shirt off and emptying my pockets.  I'd even taken off my belt.  Then the phone rang, and I walked out to the kitchen to see if it was a phone call from someone I wanted to talk to.  No message was left, but I did notice that we had a couple messages, so I checked them.  Keisha came in the kitchen and starting calling out, 'Oscar... Oscar...'  Oscar is   my mom 's boyfriend, and when she lived with us, he would call almost every day for her, leaving a message that began like this:'Margaret...  Maaar-gret... Maaaarr-gret!'  When Keisha said that, I asked her if she wanted to call her   Nana  later.  She said yes.  Then I realized that we needed to recharge our   BigZoo.com  long distance card.  To do that, I would need to get on the Internet.  So I sat down at the computer, and, of course, I had to put some music on.  So I did.  Then I connected to the Internet, and of course, I had to check my email and blogs and stuff.  Then Jennie mentioned that dinner was ready, so we sat down for dinner, and the computer was still connected.  We ate dinner, and I returned to the computer.  I posted a couple things to my blogs, answered some email, made some comments to others' posts.  I finally realized that I still need to recharge our BigZoo.com card.  So, I changed into some jeans and put on the sweatshirt that I'd worn this morning before Keisha went to school.  Also, Keisha's been upset with me because she couldn't find the tiny dolls she gave me before she got on the school bus.  I thought I came back inside and put them on the counter, but they weren't there.  Did I say she was upset?  She was.  Very.  At me.  I told her to go to her room and pray about how she was feeling.  As I've been typing this post, Jennie and Keisha were talking about where these tiny dolls could be.  I mentioned to Jennie that I was the 'point person' because Keisha gave them to me just before she got on her school bus.  Jennie asked me what I was wearing when that happened, and I realized that they were probably still in my pocket.  I checked, and yes, they were!  Keisha was glad as I handed them back to her, and she walked with Jennie toward her room.  'My Daddy lied,' she said.  Jennie let out a laugh.  'What?' I asked Jennie.  'She said, 'My Daddy lied to me'.'  'Oh.'  It wasn't that I was intentionally trying to keep the dolls from her; I'd just forgotten where I'd placed them.  I had planned to help Keisha find them, once I got the BigZoo.com card recharged, and - oh yes, that's right - I still have to take the dog out.  I'm amazed at his patience.  I really am.  So, now, I conclude this post.  It's after 7:30 PM.  I'm going to recharge the BigZoo.com card like I said I would an hour ago, and then I'm going to take Jake for his walk.  After that, I'm going to come home, Keisha will call her   Nana , and the world will be in harmony once more.   My world  at least.  Maybe.  Now, where are my shoes?         ",

Some other people (friends?) and I were being chased through a multi-story building with a parking lot by a psychopath.  It also took place at a park nearby.  The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama.  As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy.  Below are some things that I can remember, though:  - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work.  He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor.  We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between.  I remember something like this being done in the movie '  Being John Malchovich '. - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor.  We had somehow thought that it was a 'safe haven' - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM.  By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.         ",

Just where is your silver lining?  We're not into peddling pessimism, but a hearty does of reality comes in handy now and again.  The proverbial 'wrench in the system' can strike anywhere, anytime.  Unexpected change -- it's the law.   Expect it.   Change happens.  It's one of the few constants in society.  Commonly associated with negative circumstances and outcomes, unexpected change often gets a bad rap.  Yet, unexpected change can be exhilarating and extremely positive.  I feel a Paradigm Shift&trade; coming on!  Plan on it.   Rule of thumb:  'Plan weekly, adapt daily.'  When reviewing your daily activities, factor in time for unexpected changes -- things that throw your schedule off track.  You'll feel less frustrated and more in control.  Be prepared.  Go with it.   Kicking and screaming will only get you so far.  Change is good.  Adapting, adjusting, and making modifications to changing circumstances will yield new opportunities, new ideas, and new perspectives. Unexpected change -- your friend indeed!

I have been listening to the governor talk about the need to overhaul our state tax system.  The one that troubles me most is the increase to the cigarette tax.  I have heard that Virginia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, tax per pack.  That seems to be the overwhelming reason given to raise it.  If the revenue generated from this increase was to go directly to treating the illnesses of smokers with no reduction in the current amounts going there (i.e. an increase in actual spending), I would not have a problem with it.  But, I have observed politicians long enough to know that this will not be the case.  I point to the Virginia Lottery as my case in point.  When we (the voters) were sold on the concept of a lottery, we were told that all the profits would go to education.  The good news is that the politicians held true to their word for once.  The bad news is that the amount of money that had been coming from the general fund has dropped dramatically.  Basically, they used the lottery to fund something that everyone agrees needs it, in order to be able to increase some other programs.  I do not doubt that our current politicians would do the same thing with a cigarette tax.  Now, if they are just trying to raise more general revenue, this is also not a good idea.  I point to New York City as an example for this one.  They recently, within the last 2 years, raised the per pack tax to some astronomical level, like $5 a pack.  This was intended to help ease their budget problems.  Instead, they ended up with a larger deficit than before because all this revenue failed to appear.  The reason?  Smokers, despite there lack of heeding the warnings of the danger, aren't stupid.  They know that they can go someplace else to get their cigarettes and have done so.  Heck, I'm sure that some entrepreneurs did the math and realized that they could make several trips to Virginia, load up on lots of cartons, and took them back to New York where they sold them for a hefty markup but still less than the 'legal' packs.  The bottom line, to me anyway, is that getting whatever amount we get now is better than gambling that we won't lose more by raising the rates.  I know that Julie's parents get many cartons to take back to Florida whenever they pass through because of the price difference.  They aren't the only ones.  If you raise the rate, much of this business will dry up.         ",

Mallett believes his theory is solid (straight from Einstein's Theory of Relativity), but that amassing the amount of energy necessary even to move small objects may be impossible with current knowledge. Mallett said he's been thinking about time travel since age 10, when his father died, because he wanted to go back in time to warn his dad of the dangers of smoking.

The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           ",

      "3": "           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         ",

Last September, Ohio began issuing Bicentennial license plates to help commemorate the occasion.  They have red, white, and blue on them, which also makes it patriotic.  These license plates have been a hit, especially considering the renewed patriotism in America.  The designers of this license plate have had to make some changes in the layout to accomodate the additional information.  One of these changes is the county where the license plate holder lives.  (Growing up, our family would often travel from Cincinnati to Toledo where my dad grew up.  One of the ways we'd pass the time is to notice the license plates of the cars around us.  We'd be interested in those from out of state and those from Canada (Ontario), and we'd also notice the different Ohio counties represented.  This tradition is something we still whenever we drive.  It was easy to note which cars are from which county because it was spelled out on the bottom center of the license plate.)  The Ohio Bicentennial license plate now has a small square county sticker with a number corresponding to the alphabetical order of the county in the list of all 88 counties.  For example, I live in Dayton, Ohio, which is in Montgomery county.  In the alphabetical list Montgomery is the 57th county.  I often travel to Cincinnati and back, so I pass through Warren (83), Butler (09), and Hamilton (31).  Now, below this large number is the name of the county, but it is in very small letters.  These numbers are fine and dandy if you've memorized the alphabetical list of the counties.  But who in Ohio has done that?  My guess is that very few, if any, know them all by memory.  (Actually, this was something we had to memorize when I was studying Ohio history in junior high school.  At the time, I didn't think I would need to remember.)  My fellow Ohioans don't appreciate me tailgating them to see which county they are from.  So, what am I to do?  Well, I have compiled the alphabetical list for me personally, and for whomever else is interested.  So here goes:                      01      ADAMS      45      LICKING            02      ALLEN      46      LOGAN            03      ASHLAND      47      LORAIN            04      ASHTABULA      48      LUCAS            05      ATHENS      49      MADISON           06      AUGLAIZE      50      MAHONING            07      BELMONT      51      MARION            08      BROWN      52      MEDINA            09      BUTLER      53      MEIGS            10      CARROLL      54      MERCER            11      CHAMPAIGN      55      MIAMI            12      CLARK      56      MONROE            13      CLERMONT      57      MONTGOMERY            14      CLINTON      58      MORGAN            15      COLUMBIANA      59      MORROW            16      COSHOCTON      60      MUSKINGUM            17      CRAWFORD      61      NOBLE            18      CUYAHOGA      62      OTTAWA            19      DARKE      63      PAULDING            20      DEFIANCE      64      PERRY            21      DELAWARE      65      PICAWAY            22      ERIE      66      PIKE            23      FAIRFIELD      67      PORTAGE            24      FAYETTE      68      PREBLE            25      FRANKLIN      69      PUTNAM            26      FULTON      70      RICHLAND            27      GALLIA      71      ROSS            28      GEAUGA      72      SANDUSKY            29      GREENE      73      SCIOTO            30      GUERNSEY      74      SENECA            31      HAMILTON      75      SHELBY            32      HANCOCK      76      STARK            33      HARDIN      77   SUMMIT            34      HARRISON      78      TRUMBULL            35      HENRY      79      TUSCARAWAS            36      HIGHLAND      80      UNION            37      HOCKING      81      VAN WERT            38      HOLMES      82      VINTON            39      HURON      83      WARREN            40      JACKSON      84      WASHINGTON            41      JEFFERSON      85      WAYNE            42      KNOX      86      WILLIAMS            43      LAKE      87      WOOD            44      LAWRENCE      88      WYANDOT              ",

For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end.

It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.

Since recruiters charge a fairly hefty percentage for their services, it makes me wonder whether employers are using them at all these days, or if they give preference to candidates that come to them directly, without the extra price tag.  This is not to say that I haven't found jobs through recruiters in the past - just that in today's market, I'm wondering whether they are still of any use...     ",

      "2": "           I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.         ",

      "1": "           It's not new.  For example, my Government teacher in high school referred to little-d democrats and big-d democrats, as well as little-r republicans and big-r republicans.  Usually the terms distinguish between the theory and the party.  It has never occurred to me to apply actual rules to their use.  I try to distinguish between upper- and lower-case in both text and conversation when I feel the need.  In general, the common popular usages are almost universally in reference to a party, even when the speaker claims otherwise, so it's not worth inquiring further.  If, in conversation, I claim simply to be a republican, and the listener hears 'party,' that is generally his or her problem, not mine.  One might as well carry around a pre-made disclaimer to be read every time one says 'god.'  More to the point, to most people I have observed, the distinction is insignificant or irrelevant.  I feel most politically-minded people became so because of issues rather than theory.  Theory usually comes later, and is grafted to become inseparable from the issues.  Postscript:  To be fair, the term 'little-d democratic' is far more frequent than 'little-r republican,' because 'democratic' is such a commonly used term to define a method of decision-making.  Because no one thinks much about how this country is arguably a republic, or why it was designed as one, and because of the cultural saturation of our political parties, it's almost pointless to attempt a distinction between republican/Republican in casual company.  Since (R)epublican has such a universally illustrative meaning, why bother with such a minor quibble as capitalization?  And so it goes.         ",

Ok, I went to this site with linkage to a site with linkage to another site that had this really cool test about what level of hell you would be in, so of course, I had to take it.    It's supposedly taken directly from Dante's booky thing.  I thought it was pretty cool.  Here are my results, and the thingy that explains the results.  The bold one is the place I'd actually be, and the italicized ones are the ones that I got a highish score on.  The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level | Score Purgatory | High Level 1 - Limbo | Low Level 2 | Low Level 3 | Low Level 4 | Moderate Level 5 | Very Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low Level 7 | Low Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low    Level descriptions    Take the test  (Go take it!!!)    And here's what it means:   Purgatory You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.  (This is me) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 1 - Limbo Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 2 You have come to a place mute of all light, where the wind bellows as the sea does in a tempest. This is the realm where the lustful spend eternity. Here, sinners are blown around endlessly by the unforgiving winds of unquenchable desire as punishment for their transgressions. The infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine, whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. You have betrayed reason at the behest of your appetite for pleasure, and so here you are doomed to remain. Cleopatra and Helen of Troy are two that share in your fate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 3 In the third circle, you find yourself amidst eternal rain, maledict, cold, and heavy. The gluttons are punished here, lying in the filthy mixture of shadows and of putrid water. Because you consumed in excess, you meet your fate beneath the cold, dirty rain, amidst the other souls that there lay unhappily in the stinking mud. Cerebus, a canine monster cruel and uncouth with his three heads and red eyes, dwells in this level. He growls and tears at the damned with his teeth and claws. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 4  Just before the river Styx is the Fourth Level of Hell. Here, the prodigal and the avaricious suffer their punishment, as they roll weights back and forth against one another. You will share eternal damnation with others who either wasted and lived greedily and insatiably, or who stockpiled their fortunes, hoarding everything and sharing nothing. Plutus, the wolf-like demon of wealth, dwells here.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 5 The river Styx runs through this level of Hell, and in it are punished the wrathful and the gloomy. The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. The latter are gurgling in the black mud, slothful and sullen, withdrawn from the world. Their lamentations bubble to the surface as they try to repeat a doleful hymn, though with unbroken words they cannot say it. Because you lived a cruel, vindictive and hateful life, you meet your fate in the Styx. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 6 - The City of Dis You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 7 Guarded by the Minotaur, who snarls in fury, and encircled within the river Phlegethon, filled with boiling blood, is the Seventh Level of Hell. The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment. The stench here is overpowering. This level is also home to the wood of the suicides- stunted and gnarled trees with twisting branches and poisoned fruit. At the time of final judgement, their bodies will hang from their branches. In those branches the Harpies, foul birdlike creatures with human faces, make their nests. Beyond the wood is scorching sand where those who committed violence against God and nature are showered with flakes of fire that rain down against their naked bodies. Blasphemers and sodomites writhe in pain, their tongues more loosed to lamentation, and out of their eyes gushes forth their woe. Usurers, who followed neither nature nor art, also share company in the Seventh Level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 8- the Malebolge  Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.  (i don't really know why I got this one...I'm not a whore or a theif.  I think it may be the whole malice bit.) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 9 - Cocytus This is the deepest level of hell, where the fallen angel Satan himself resides. His wings flap eternally, producing chilling cold winds that freeze the thick ice found in Cocytus. The three faces of Satan, black, red, and yellow, can be seen with mouths gushing bloody foam and eyes forever weeping, as they chew on the three traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. This place is furthest removed from the source of all light and warmth. Sinners here are frozen deep in the ice, faces out, eyes and mouths frozen shut. Traitors against God, country, family, and benefactors lament their sins in this frigid pit of despair.       "

I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, 'Shit!' when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was 'Zorro' and 'Traffic,' so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).  I really hope she gets one someday, because she's just really first-rate.

In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.

It's massive depression marked by the onset of a new week, mostly on Sundays but auspiciously clear in the slow points of really good weekends.  My dad almost got robbed today. He was asleep and the back door was open, then he heard movement and screamed, 'HEY!', and whoever it was ran out and slammed the door...nothing was taken. It's also all my fault since I took Katie to Guard this morning and, in our hurry, we left the door unlocked. I felt horrible, and still do, considering. Of course, da doesn't care.  He also just happened to come across a copy of the movie  Memento  on Friday, so we're going to watch that here in a second. Just happened to, mind, I didn't even tell him about Psychology, and suddenly he goes, 'I got this movie called 'Memento', it came out awhile back...' And then I told him the whole plot of the movie, the life story of the guy, his brain damage, his credit card numbers, and other cooler stuff, and dad was just sitting there going, 'Uh...that's cool.'  I drove about a hundred miles today, it was badass. I went to Opry Mills and bought a really cool toboggan, which happens to be really cool, albeit a plain, black colour. Guess whar I got it from.  And I heard CHINGY on the way home, and I cried when he said, 'POKEchop.' It, too, was sweet.   Y tu mama, tambien. OOH BIOTCH. Heheheh.

It's ok. It's a bit hard to chew. It also tastes weird, like...part pizza, and part philly cheese steak. It makes for an interesting conflagration.

      "2": "           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",

You may need the benefits of 'reflect'ology.  Ever heard of it?  'Reflect'ology is a practice that's been around for many moons.  Reflecting about or evaluating the past week is a natural process that can help relieve stress, identify weaknesses, and get you back on your feet.  Don't feel pressured -- just relax and consider these tips for evaluating your week:   Examination.   Create a checklist of five or six self-evaluation questions and keep them in your planning system.  Examples include  'What challenges did I face this week and how did I overcome them?' 'What goals did I not achieve and why?' 'What can I learn from the week as a whole?'   Regular checkup.   Make an appointment with yourself each week and choose a place that is quiet.  Review your questions before you plan the next week.  Prevention.   You'll soon identify ineffective habits and patterns.  This knowledge will help you prevent making the same mistakes in the future.

      "3": "           when i read things like this i don't know whether to laugh or cry: Ga. school evolution debate goes to trial    April 6, 2004  |  ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a school district's practice of posting disclaimers inside science textbooks saying evolution is 'a theory, not a fact.'   The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.             ",

We took the 7 south to Main & Third, i.e., the epicenter of Dayton, Ohio (the hub from which all major   RTA  activity occurs).  Then we transferred to the number 5, which took us down Far Hills Avenue just past Dorothy Lane.  From there we walked 1/4 mile to our friends' home, where we had a house church service.  I really am glad we went because it wasn't just a communion service.  We alternated singing songs about the cross with reading passages from the Bible about the cross.  Nearly everyone in attendance got to read.  It felt like I was hearing some of these passages for the first time, in some cases.  The one I read was   Colossians 1:15-23  and   2:13-15   After the service, we walked back to the bus stop.  I saw that the next bus would not arrive for another 50 minutes.  So we walked about 3/4 mile north to the   Dorothy Lane Market .  Jennie bought a smoothie while Keisha and I got some bottled water.  We then walked to the closest bus stop and waited.

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          ",

I then made my way around the outer walls of the store, examining the selections they were renting.  I was trying to think of any titles that were on my favorites list.  I then ventured to the alphabetized collection.  Some of the movies I would like to have were too pricey for me.  Finally, I settled for the   Sleepers DVD .

If you keep messing with your environment and deciding to change too much (or thinking you can, which is worse), no matter how good the control feels right now, if it's real or not, you're going to wear yourself out.  And moreover (and more importantly; no offense, but I  am  a suicide kid), it's wearing  me  out. Honestly, pick a path and stick to it. Remember what happened to the kid who wandered too far off the path because he thought he could come back without any problems: messily devoured by wolves and then peed on. I don't think, dead or alive, I would much like to have something urinating on me, would you?  This really has gone on long enough, all of you. You win, stop the guilt. It's either him or her, it's not both. Sometimes we get denied an option because not everyone thinks alike. That is NOT within the scope of your control. If Becca is going to be depressed and guilt's flying all over the place, I'm sorry. But that's nothing you can feasibly control. This may sound like an asshole thing to say, but think about it: even if you say, 'Fuck off Philip, you gay!' it's still not going to make him like Becca, and you're not going to have him either. What more, she's going to think you broke up with him out of pity for her, and she's STILL not going to like you (and if Becca's reading this, aren't I right?!) because she's going to see it. Something has to get lost, it's called acceptable casualties.

Alright, on to me :) I'm fucked up on trileptol. This shit is killing me. I'm a fucking walking zombie with some hot looking Chucks on. I swear, my head hasn't spun this much since the last time I stuck my head in a dryer...which has been...oh, let's see...never, right. I seriously want to blow up. I hate fucking being a bipolar, it sucks a fucking nut. I'm really really super-fucking manic about now. It makes me ultra-insightful and fun, but I really fucking hate it. I say fuck a lot, people tend to like me less sometimes when they say something that could be taken the slightest bit offensively. I seriously can't type 'seriously,' or anything on the first try, for that matter. And the worst part of it is: I'm out the fuck of fucking options. I have ONE LEFT: lithium carbonate, and that requires me to go stay in the FUCKING UNIT  AGAIN ! Fuck me! Like hell they'll take me back! AAAAGGH! I'm going to explode. I haven't had a moodswing like this since Linds...actually, this is worse than that. I really feel like my heart is about to start pumping so hard it's going to come out of my mouth, but that I'll enjoy it when it happens. I know, all of this sounds weird, none of you will understand what the fuck is going on, but that's alright. I would actually prefer if you didn't say anything about it. I can't explain it right now that you could.  It's just a whole hell of a lot of crazy energy waiting to come out. My heart is a caffeine factory and my brain is an amphetamined, angel dusted foreman. I'm the bipolar I king of the whole fucking universe. Yes, I typed bipolar  ONE . Something crazy is happening right now. I keep thinking about Picasso, the way he cut off his ear during mania. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't. Actually, I've learned enough to not be so crazy as to act on any of my shit ideas I get when I'm manic, but I really think some crazy shit sometimes when it's happening. It's all here. Don't expect any of the things I say here to happen, I'm smarter than that (and no smart-ass comments to that, or I'll eat you).   It sucks because I know that very very soon, I'm going to come down and bomb the fuck out, I'm probably going to get so depressed I won't know what to do with myself except sleep and think about nothing. That's what I do these days when I'm depressed: concentrate on abso-fucking-loutely nothing. It helps. It doesn't tangle my depressed stuff with my good stuff, it's not worth it trying to cheer myself up during depression, it's not that simple, and it doesn't work, so fuck it. I plan to keep my good memories in tact for mania and baseline so that there there in whole form and ready to be used as they should be, not as death-traps waiting to bring me down (although sometimes, as in now, they could be useful).  I think I just felt myself beginning to drop. You can't run a car forever without it stalling out and coming to a complete stop. I puff the last of my psychic gasoline and come to a screeching hault wrapped around a telephone poll but quite alive, just bleeding. Every time. What a feeling it is. That's the best description I could give, the best yet. I give on this post. It made me feel better, it filled the last half-hour quite well. If you actually read all this, I'm having your children, come to Unca Josh's right now. Peace out, y'all mega wonderous pals o' mine.    "

I can't tell you where we're coming from, but I can say very poetically, yet truly, that we come from a place that reeks of decay and fright, a dead fear of something we can't give a name to.  Ah yes, normal. A term used by the failed experiment called psychology to encompass an average. Who defines normal? It's the same people that define what certain words mean. Who defines what 'pen' means? Did you all read 'Frindle'? If so, you'd know the answer. It was a person, the same creature that breaths, fucks, shits, eats, just like all the rest of us, no different, no more safe from dying, getting lucky, or anything than any of the rest of us. It's someone that still has a seizure threshold, has to pay taxes, keeps a circadian rhythm, all that good shit. Normal is over-rated and pointless.  No one can see inside like this, we may be outcasted to some extent...so what? We already talked about this before, yet still, this might be good for everyone else to hear: why bleed yourself over someone that's going to think they're better than you because you have a 'problem'? The only difference between us and those people is that ours has a given name in a failed experiment/psychology book. Someone who says they don't have problems is a fucking liar. There's their problem right there: denial of problems. If you don't have them, you will. If you deny them, you're fucked. Life is all about accepting their occurance and taking them as they come, depressed as one could be or no.  I say down with the distinction, I say fuck psychology and their godawful classifications, I say separate the diagnosis branch from the treatment branch, because its current incarnation is causing all within it quite a bit of isolation, self-doubt. It's in some people's nature to doubt everyone else, this is only making it worse.  Yet still, they will not, no one's really listening to me, really. All I can tell you is my two favorite words in the whole world when it comes to things like this: FUCK IT. Fuck them, sorry you all, but fuck you. If you don't like me, blow me. If you can't deal with it and shut the fuck up about it, even if you were my best friend before, then suck on my goddamn goads because you are a complete fucking retard. And people, that's just the way it goes, that last sentence may have been a bit abrasive, but that's what everyone really needs to hear: the cold, hard truth of it, just like life really is. It might be better for some of us to hear it that way rather than me just pussy-footing around it with demure, blas language than to tell it to you with all the hatred and anger I can conjure from myself, and I did. You need to hear that I don't care who you are, I don't care how many of you have to go before I get it all straight: if you can't accept it, then you're the one that has problems, you're not helping me and I don't need you, and more over, you're not helping yourself.  I can see the day people like that wake up and figure out: 'oh my god, what have I done?' That awful, awful day you come to realize that everyone is the same, everyone's fucked up as you are, nobody understands a motherfucking thing, everyone's drowning in something. Yeah, we all are. But the fun of life is taking that next big breath, and if we can respect everyone's right to take it, and respect the fact that no one really can have real dignity while they're drowning, then it's all right.  Life is about the right now, it's about coming to accept that there's a lot of shit here, and the only way to make yourself happy is to do just that: MAKE. No one was put here to give you anything. You can choose your miseries and your elations, even if you're messed up like we are. We can fight the feelings, we don't have to be one way or the other, we can just be ok. I don't have to be manic or depressed, I can just be in the middle. It's not all brain chemistry. If that were the case, we'd never fucking be alright, no one really understand the brain all that well.   Humanity is better than every other species becase we have a choice. Life is about taking that choice and making the most of it, respecting everyone else's choices, and choosing the things that will really make us happy, maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but sometime. And in the mean time, we can life with the happiness of knowing that we made the right decisions. Everything can really work out if you know what your options are.  The secret is just taking a step, whether you know where it leads, whether you can walk or not. MAKE your way, and you can take another great big breath. Hell, one day you may even reach the shore for good.    "

Gave Advice in 2002  By Dana Priest and R. Jeffrey Smith Washington Post Staff Writers Tuesday, June 8, 2004; Page A01    In August 2002, the Justice Department advised the White House that torturing al Qaeda terrorists in captivity abroad 'may be justified,' and that international laws against torture 'may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations' conducted in President Bush's war on terrorism, according to a newly obtained memo.          If a government employee were to torture a suspect in captivity, 'he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the Al Qaeda terrorist network,' said the memo, from the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, written in response to a CIA request for legal guidance. It added that arguments centering on 'necessity and self-defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability' later.   The memo seems to counter the pre-Sept. 11, 2001, assumption that U.S. government personnel would never be permitted to torture captives. It was offered after the CIA began detaining and interrogating suspected al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the wake of the attacks, according to government officials familiar with the document.   The legal reasoning in the 2002 memo, which covered treatment of al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, was later used in a March 2003 report by Pentagon lawyers assessing interrogation rules governing the Defense Department's detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At that time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had asked the lawyers to examine the logistical, policy and legal issues associated with interrogation techniques.   Bush administration officials say flatly that, despite the discussion of legal issues in the two memos, it has abided by international conventions barring torture, and that detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere have been treated humanely, except in the cases of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq for which seven military police soldiers have been charged.   Still, the 2002 and 2003 memos reflect the Bush administration's desire to explore the limits on how far it could legally go in aggressively interrogating foreigners suspected of terrorism or of having information that could thwart future attacks.   In the 2002 memo, written for the CIA and addressed to White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, the Justice Department defined torture in a much narrower way, for example, than does the U.S. Army, which has historically carried out most wartime interrogations.   In the Justice Department's view -- contained in a 50-page document signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee and obtained by The Washington Post -- inflicting moderate or fleeting pain does not necessarily constitute torture. Torture, the memo says, 'must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.'   By contrast, the Army's Field Manual 34-52, titled 'Intelligence Interrogations,' sets more restrictive rules. For example, the Army prohibits pain induced by chemicals or bondage; forcing an individual to stand, sit or kneel in abnormal positions for prolonged periods of time; and food deprivation. Under mental torture, the Army prohibits mock executions, sleep deprivation and chemically induced psychosis.   Human rights groups expressed dismay at the Justice Department's legal reasoning yesterday.   'It is by leaps and bounds the worst thing I've seen since this whole Abu Ghraib scandal broke,' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch. 'It appears that what they were contemplating was the commission of war crimes and looking for ways to avoid legal accountability. The effect is to throw out years of military doctrine and standards on interrogations.'   But a spokesman for the White House counsel's office said, 'The president directed the military to treat al Qaeda and Taliban humanely and consistent with the Geneva Conventions.'            ",

Ok, I went to this site with linkage to a site with linkage to another site that had this really cool test about what level of hell you would be in, so of course, I had to take it.    It's supposedly taken directly from Dante's booky thing.  I thought it was pretty cool.  Here are my results, and the thingy that explains the results.  The bold one is the place I'd actually be, and the italicized ones are the ones that I got a highish score on.  The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to Purgatory!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level | Score Purgatory | High Level 1 - Limbo | Low Level 2 | Low Level 3 | Low Level 4 | Moderate Level 5 | Very Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very Low Level 7 | Low Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate Level 9 - Cocytus | Very Low    Level descriptions    Take the test  (Go take it!!!)    And here's what it means:   Purgatory You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.  (This is me) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 1 - Limbo Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 2 You have come to a place mute of all light, where the wind bellows as the sea does in a tempest. This is the realm where the lustful spend eternity. Here, sinners are blown around endlessly by the unforgiving winds of unquenchable desire as punishment for their transgressions. The infernal hurricane that never rests hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine, whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. You have betrayed reason at the behest of your appetite for pleasure, and so here you are doomed to remain. Cleopatra and Helen of Troy are two that share in your fate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 3 In the third circle, you find yourself amidst eternal rain, maledict, cold, and heavy. The gluttons are punished here, lying in the filthy mixture of shadows and of putrid water. Because you consumed in excess, you meet your fate beneath the cold, dirty rain, amidst the other souls that there lay unhappily in the stinking mud. Cerebus, a canine monster cruel and uncouth with his three heads and red eyes, dwells in this level. He growls and tears at the damned with his teeth and claws. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 4  Just before the river Styx is the Fourth Level of Hell. Here, the prodigal and the avaricious suffer their punishment, as they roll weights back and forth against one another. You will share eternal damnation with others who either wasted and lived greedily and insatiably, or who stockpiled their fortunes, hoarding everything and sharing nothing. Plutus, the wolf-like demon of wealth, dwells here.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 5 The river Styx runs through this level of Hell, and in it are punished the wrathful and the gloomy. The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. The latter are gurgling in the black mud, slothful and sullen, withdrawn from the world. Their lamentations bubble to the surface as they try to repeat a doleful hymn, though with unbroken words they cannot say it. Because you lived a cruel, vindictive and hateful life, you meet your fate in the Styx. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 6 - The City of Dis You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 7 Guarded by the Minotaur, who snarls in fury, and encircled within the river Phlegethon, filled with boiling blood, is the Seventh Level of Hell. The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment. The stench here is overpowering. This level is also home to the wood of the suicides- stunted and gnarled trees with twisting branches and poisoned fruit. At the time of final judgement, their bodies will hang from their branches. In those branches the Harpies, foul birdlike creatures with human faces, make their nests. Beyond the wood is scorching sand where those who committed violence against God and nature are showered with flakes of fire that rain down against their naked bodies. Blasphemers and sodomites writhe in pain, their tongues more loosed to lamentation, and out of their eyes gushes forth their woe. Usurers, who followed neither nature nor art, also share company in the Seventh Level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 8- the Malebolge  Many and varied sinners suffer eternally in the multi-leveled Malebolge, an ampitheatre-shapped pit of despair Wholly of stone and of an iron colour: Those guilty of fraudulence and malice; the seducers and pimps, who are whipped by horned demons; the hypocrites, who struggle to walk in lead-lined cloaks; the barraters, who are ducked in boiling pitch by demons known as the Malebranche. The simonists, wedged into stone holes, and whose feet are licked by flames, kick and writhe desperately. The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves. Some wallow in human excrement. Serpents writhe and wrap around men, sometimes fusing into each other. Bodies are torn apart. When you arrive, you will want to put your hands over your ears because of the lamentations of the sinners here, who are afflicted with scabs like leprosy, and lay sick on the ground, furiously scratching their skin off with their nails. Indeed, justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.  (i don't really know why I got this one...I'm not a whore or a theif.  I think it may be the whole malice bit.) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Level 9 - Cocytus This is the deepest level of hell, where the fallen angel Satan himself resides. His wings flap eternally, producing chilling cold winds that freeze the thick ice found in Cocytus. The three faces of Satan, black, red, and yellow, can be seen with mouths gushing bloody foam and eyes forever weeping, as they chew on the three traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. This place is furthest removed from the source of all light and warmth. Sinners here are frozen deep in the ice, faces out, eyes and mouths frozen shut. Traitors against God, country, family, and benefactors lament their sins in this frigid pit of despair.       "

It's bad enough with her little convincing smile and pathetic voice, every inch of my being wants to surrender but I CANNOT! So please don't tell. Ok, I know you won't but I'm just making sure.   Ugh. It's been a couple hours since I started this. Presently, I'm working on the CD. It doesn't have nearly as many tracks as I promised, but there's some stuff that no one's heard, older stuff, and some special commentaries!!! Three songs that are newish.  Let Me Go ,  Close My Eyes , and  So Low . And I think  Rhyme  is gonna be on there, an early bass cut of  Close My Eyes , and little snippets of experiment songs called  Down  and  Scarecrowman . And commentaries! From me! I'm so dumb. But I think you all will like it. I know your up to your asses in  Broken Me  and since I deleted it, it's pretty much not going on there, unless someone can get me a copy soon. And only one person has the original cut of  My Solution  on CD anymore. But that's ok. You guys are sick of those, I know. I made such a big deal out of them and now it's all over.  Whatever. My breath reeks of disfermented hopps and I'm making CDs like crazy. I have my little case here, and if one of these happen to have either of the two glory boys on it, you all will be first to know. I'm just going to leave this post as is, fo shieezey. I'll be back in a few minutes.  HAHA I found a copy of  Broken Me . Woot, it's going on there next.  Ok so...the tracklist so far...  1. Introduction 2. So Low 3. Goodbye My Friend 4. Let Me Go 5. Enjoying the CD? 6. Broken Me 7. My Solution (acoustic) 8. Down (demo cut) 9. Scarecrowman (demo cut) ( very  incomplete) 10. Little Rhyme 11. Bass riff (early  Close My Eyes  demos) 12. Until I Fall Away (cover) 13. That's all! 14. Close My Eyes  This CD is sounding good. I just finished remixing  Down ...it turned out really good for having four parts in it. And I left one intelligible line in at one point, so you all get to hear what it might have sounded like. WOOT. Time to mix  Scarecrowman  and make it sound like I wasn't playing with the damned riff for the first time that day...which I was...it was the same day I got the recorder. I recorded  Scarecrowman  and  Goodbye My Friend  for the first time.     Memories  ....  Wow...I didn't remember, but I gave up on trying to coordinate the guitar parts on  Scarecrowman  without drums so I started soloing...it sounds mostly the same, or bad...but there's this one place where it sounds fraggin' AMAZING! I'm letting it master itself right now...  Right...just a few more to go. I'm going to start a lyrics booklet that I'll email, including the deleted lyrics, even the ones to the cover. And a transcript of what I'm saying during the little retarded commentaries. But not the subliminal messages. I mean, what good are subliminal messages if you know what they're saying? Duh!  Beer tastes awful, but I'm thirsty. I could never be an alcoholic. I dunno what my dad sees in this shit. Gross.  Here's the boring part. Waiting for  Little Rhyme  to burn itself. God...every time me and Alex play this, we both look at each other and groan and say, 'this so is sooooooooooo long!' and then we play it, because we always do, right after  Broken Me  and followed by  My Solution . We're beasts in those sessions. Alex kills himself trying to doublebass and I just kill myself jumping off of things, hitting my head on things, throwing things, yelling things, screaming all the lines of the song, saying them backwards, saying them in Arameic while doing a handstand, smoking a hashpipe, and playing my guitar which is somehow infested with a swarm of killer bees. This friends...is the part of the evening where the caffeine wears off and the alcohol kicks in.  As you all know, I have no alcohol tolerance whatsoever. And while this is a nonalcoholic beverage, it can't help but have a bit in it, because of the nature of its production. It has less than NyQuil in it. However, I have no tolerance, and were I to finish this bottle I might be a bit drunk, and me drunk...that's a bad thing. I'm either tired or depressed, or sometimes I say really funny things and start crying about them. This is another reason why I will never be an alcoholic.  I just heard a pop. That means  Rhyme  is done.   The bass riff is done. It's pretty shaky at the end cuz I forgot the main riff. But you'll get a good glimpse into where the riff for  Close My Eyes  came from. Damn...that was a rough song. It took most of the year to work out the perfect words. And the music was impossible. So one day I heard this riff in storage, and something clicked and I nailed it.  Close  is the last song on this record by the way.  Pop.   Until I Fall Away ...I haven't listened to that track since Christmas, when I recorded it...or thereabouts. It's a Gin Blossoms song, probly my fav of theirs...3 on  New Miserable Experience ...if you haven't heard of the Blossoms, I really suggest them. They don't sound anything like my music, but they're incredible musicians and songwriters, and they're coming to Georgia and bygod if I'm not going to see them. They're from Tempe, Arizona...that's where we're gonna be, along with Tuscon and Phoenix in a few weeks, so I get to visit the home of the Blossoms! And get some Coodukx shakes that Abby was talking about...heheh...I can't remember the real name of that place anymore....Iji, I think it was....Captain Iji? I dunno, it sounds pretty close. I'm plastered. Pop.  The outro is done, and now the last and awesomeest song.  Here I go.  Alright kids. It's burning, but I'm gonna go now and as soon as it's done, I'm going to listen to it and cry. And then, I'm going to burn all of you copies of this wonderful endeavor, and I sincerely hope you enjoy.  Starting on the lyrics booklet/notes thing.  Ciao for now, friends.      "

The man says, 'I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke,' and turns to the ostrich. 'What's yours?'  'I'll have the same,' says the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress returns with the order. 'That will be $6.40 please,' and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out exact change for payment.  The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, 'I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke,' and the ostrich says, 'I'll have the same.' Once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.  This becomes a routine until late one evening, the two enter again.  'The usual?' asks the waitress.  'No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and salad,' says the man.  'Same for me,' says the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress comes with the order and says, 'That will be $12.62.'  Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.  The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. 'Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?'  'Well,' says the man, 'several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, just put my hand in my pocket, and the right amount of money would always be there.'  'That's brilliant!' says the waitress. 'Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!'  'That's right! Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,' says the man.  The waitress asks, 'One other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?'  The man sighs, pauses, and answers, 'My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.   [via email from   Mom ]          ",

My new name under  this  language is Gaeshae Antonie Krikkopher Khandler. YES. Notice the lakk of 'c's. Well, sure, I was ranting about it. It was late last night, and we just sat there making up a language.  Yggil qaid dinngy. Bekause I  am  the apple. I'll post it all latr, when I can get to it. It's on a notepad on my Internet-unready komputer in my room. Sadness.   Between Times  is the greatest song ever, I listened to it about a thousand times minus 998 this morning. And I also listened to  In Dominae Sathana , which is also a good song because of the really amazing guitar work. And  If It Ends Tomorrow , and the beginning of  The Fifth Illusion , heh. 'AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH,'...I listened to another on there, but I have since forgotten of the name of it, which is espekially gay when trying to put the names on a komputer database.   This day is just  unnatural , it's so good. Probably one of the best I've had in months. I got 100 on a geometry quiz, then I finished my homework in there, I got 100 on a biology quiz, I finished my homework in there, I got everything done for today in study hall, whikh is really happifying since I hardly ever do. Maybe that's the sekret to my depression, to finish all my homework  early  and not have any undue anxiety...  Nah.  A quikk random thing, the prinkiple of tires. Now, tires akt upon the funktion of gripping the road, mukh like a train grips the trakk. If you lose that grip (as I did during the last snow), there's no hope for you, exkept to hope to start gripping before you hit something. And in my case, I ran off the road. But that prinkiple of aktually holding to the road, as if we were on a trakk...awesome. And gay at the same time, I should know, since I did it, ran straight off the road, off a little hill. Some dudes kame and helped us push the kar out though, so it was ok.   Hope it keeps raining through the weekend, even though I'll be doing nothing at my dad's all that time, I enjoy the rain. Go listen to  Between Times  a few dozen times and drink some Kherry Coke and play EVO. Bones and ashes of my formerly komplicated life of talking on the phone konstantly.  Actually, I konsider this an evolution, since  while  being on the phone, I am also doing all these other things, NIK(C)E. Why kouldn't I see it before, exkluding my life from my sokiality probably would've ended me, had I not done something about it, which I did subkonkiously. I'll look bakk on myself one day and laugh.  Ha fukking ha.    "

Marvin Walberg  recommends  volunteer work and special interest groups .  I'm not sure whether the link I've referenced above is going to last, so allow me to do some pasting from the article:  Volunteering is a wonderful way to meet new people, demonstrate workplace skills, network like crazy and get the good feeling of helping others. And every community needs volunteers.  How do you find out what's available in the world of volunteering in your city? Go to your main public library, chamber of commerce or any hospital system. You will find a plethora of opportunities, and from a 'building your resume' perspective, volunteer work is work and counts in the experience column. It really doesn't matter that you do it for free.  Everyone has interests aside from the workaday world. How about you? Do you like bowling, bird watching, table tennis or wood carving? In most cities you can obtain a listing of special interest groups at your public library.  Understand that networking is universal. Just because someone knows nothing about what you do for a living doesn't mean he or she can't lead you to others who do. Just be prepared to introduce yourself and give a clear, understandable explanation of what you do, or want to do, for a living. Then, show up for meetings and smile. The rest will happen almost automatically.      ",

      "2": "           Johnathan - I agree with the similarities between 2004 and 1996 with regards to the motivations of the political parties.  One difference I see is what happened in the 1994 and 2002 mid-tem elections.  Historically, the party out of power gains seats in Congress in the mid-terms.  In 1994, that paragon of virtue (tic) Newt Gingrich managed to energize the Republicans on a national level to take back the House for the first time in 40 or so years.  He then of course proceeded to blow his momentum and hand Clinton the White House in 1996 through a number of missteps.  Fast forward to 2002, and Gephardt (sp?) was banking on retaking control of the House and firming control of the Senate.  Instead, the House remainined in Republican control and the Senate went back to the Republicans.  What does that mean for the upcoming election?  Probably not a damn thing, but it is a difference.  I do have to laugh at the Democrats first harping on the fact the Iraq was going to be a military disaster, which it was not.  Then they latched on to the economy being terrible, but now it is recovering very nicely.  So now they are back to Iraq and the post 'war' efforts and saying we need to get things under control.  But, I am not hearing many solutions, just pointing out the problems, which I fully agree are there.  Angie - Thanks, that makes me much less afraid of Dean.  I did not know he is a doctor.  I have not heard any of Dean's details on the medical front and will not pay attention to them unless and until he becomes the actual nominee.  But, one concern I have of government mandates on things like insurance and medicine, is that it smacks of socialism.  Canada has socialized medicine.  Everyone is covered and the quality of care is good from what I have witnessed.  The problem is with availability of some forms of treatment.  My mother, who handles the insurance for her doctor's office and has many chronic ailments (lupus, arthritis), told me the waiting list for heart catheterization is about 18 months in Canada.  The problem is, when someone needs that procedure, they need it pretty much imediately.  Most people don't survive 18 months, so they travel to the US and pony up the cash to have it done here.  I guess my point is, for right or wrong, profit is what drives most things in this country.  The insurance companies and doctors have to be able to profit from their work or they will do something else, creating a shortage.  I will be curious to see how he addressed this in Vermont.  If the government steps in much further, I am afraid that our medical system will be hurt severly.  Case in point of the profit driven results is Viagra.  I'm sure that there were many other diseases/conditions that Pfizer could have researched besides male impotence.  But, look at the original target 'audience' - Middle Aged White Males.  They knew that they would be able to make a proverbial killing from the general affluence of that market.  In the meantime, research into chronic illnesses go underfunded or totally unresearched.  Mir - I would hope that we will utilize Iraqis as much as possible.  However, given the magnitude of the problems that need to be addressed, I doubt that they have the numbers and/or specialties necessary to do it all.  If we are talking road and bridge work, I would assume that the Iraqis have the ability to do those.  But, if we are talking about updating the electrical system nationwide, they probably don't.  Heck, given what happened here over the summer, you could say that neither the US or Canada do either.         ",

I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.

Same with why they chose not to destroy Zion -- because inevitably the cycle would repeat, and they'd have to do it again.  The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.

      "4": "       This is the day.  I feel a twist of nausea permeate the recesses of my box of a soul, filling the life force therein, corrupting the stuff of mortal existence with unescapable, tumultuous urges to vomit whatever went undigested from the past week or so. As I sit here at this monitor, being bombarded by light gamma rays or whatnaught, eating some leftover chips from my last meal at my grandmother's, and sipping a Cherry Coke with bemused fervor, I feel it, that twisting, serpentine hand of fear disassembling the scraps of my rationality, decaying the origins of my learning and assimilation of scenarios. I feel screwed.  Last night I was assigned to get duck tape for the DI team. Little did we remember, and my grandmother  did , that we are in the middle of a 'fear terrorism' mentality and people have bought all duck tape and plastic with which to secure windows against the threat of viral warfare.  People, if the germ wants in, it'll  get  in, don't worry your poor, illogical, and incoherent heads.  With the two rolls given to me by my grandmother, and the one I found at the store while stocking up on  my  antiterroristic formula, caffeine, it gives us a grand total of SCREWED. The ones given me are strange...one is huge and yellow, while the other roll is...dirty. It has particles all over it.  Most likely, however, we have enough.  I woke to my  sister's  alarm clock, who, by the way, isn't at this house this weekend.  It's Getting Hot In Herre , the slut anthem of the new millenium, blasting through her open door, the new cat, Camille, scratching on mine. I was frankly overwhemled by this chaos...bombs really are louder in the morning, especially to teenage boys who  sleep . I rolled out of bed, scratching my frazzled scalp and rubbing the sleep for my eyes as I headed to the pandemonium out there, the Leviathan of noise called Nelly.   After five minutes of experimenting on how to turn off the alarm clock in the dark, and achieving my goal (worse, it happened to be my old one), I walked to the shower as slowly as possible, dreading the dire results of it ending. So, using your powers of deduction, one could ascertain that this shower consumed a quantity no less than that of the Nile's daily flow of water for five thousand years. As it ended the anxiety of which I spoke settled in on my shoulders and started shaking me, choking my being to mutate into a child of his disorder. Staving him is getting sufficiently harder with every glance at the clock, and seeing as how computer have said wonderful device  somewhere  on every screen, his iced grip colds my being with the seconds that wake.  The tick, tick, the incessance of the clock begins to drive me to chaotica, a state of complete euphoric insanity, humanity enveloped with the penchant to destroy in a mad and fearful wake. The tick is louded now, slower, it multiplies and divides faster than its amoebic kin (or is becoming as such at this point), I see my fingers smashing the keys at tremendous speeds, letting the blood from each repeated strike dance upon my lined, tired visage, my heart quickens, my brain begins thinking sans rationality, but with much in speed that the normal self would desire.  The world commences spinning out of control, the clocks are a wall of noise, my heart, on the verge of imploding on itself with its unending repetetions, the bag, once full of chips, both cheesed and plain, now on my head, suffocating my burning lungs, and the suffocation is a release from the madness, but soon becomes another twisted limb of its endless desire to give birth  again  to, to whelp  again , to create one new life in the masses of a sentient being   again  .   >   a<>> >>>i<>>>  F A L L S  into oblivion and their is much of stark contrast between the constantcy of fixed human shape and his now boiling thoughts. He is on the verge of  ! ! EXpl.......od###ing into pieces, or at least he feels as such, the strength accrued over the course of his now shortened 15 years drained and sucked dry in a matter of seconds, the vampire(DOTH STOCK YE) consumes his mind and again he  F A L L S  into darkness this time, and he feels the warmth of EUPHORIA, in nomine, ave euphoria, carry me away on your lusty back, your thoughts intuned to naught but contentment, the soul waits in purgation as the body, soulless but with none to control its spirit but nature  UNL EASH ES?  a veritable  Gotterdammerung  upon the nations of earth, moreover upon his house, now being pummeled by unquenched human REWOPpower as it consumes his form, even death is an illusion, even death is a puppet deathisminedeath is my lovesheismy lover and i am the king and OBLIVION is my servant and suddenly  I realize, it was from drinking caffeine this early in the morning. I pick up the fallen bag and throw the can in the sink, where it, like everything on the planet, will be washed and recycled in time. Nature prevails once again, she replenishes both herself and the spirit of those upon her. And for me, rationality has prevailed once again.  I, with rushing spirit and unconquerable indomitablity, and a MAJOR surge of caffeine, forth into the unknown, I ride the winds of creation into a new age, one of competetion not of feats of strength and show, but of the minds, where thought is the strongest weapon, and thoughts gauge themselves in power with each mind. Together, they are weapons of feared power, or they are unstable, as atoms, fickle bonds apt to split in seconds.  I feel the warm coils of my mentality slide back into place. Now with the surging thoughts and enforced spirit  I am  invincible .    "

      "1": "           I will ask you the similar question.  Why would anyone vote  for  John Kerry?  I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.             ",

      "4": "       'Vague thoughts torture my head,' said Sakis...right now he is correct.  The song  Between Times  has come back for me again, and now the words are getting to me, now that I understand them; after, of course, reading them on a website,   darklyrics.com , which includes the wonderful band Bal-Sagoth, with wonderful titles such as  In The Raven Haunted Forests Of Darkmier Where The Sun Does Not Shine And The Trees Eternally Choke The Light  or something to that effect, times every song on their album. But that is besides the point.  'The drums of time have stopped, the ecstatic quietude,' and I feel it, this quietude that drove me to a strange feeling this summer, and over Leigh Anne this year, it is the force, the demon, upon my shoulders that tells me to keep fighting and to make things so much worse than they are. It is a strange fate for one that could want so much from people and, in the end, with his demon, leave little to be desired.  This quiet hasn't yet settled back in, but with enough time it will. It doesn't readily trouble me as of yet; rather, I feel its fingers and feel the breath of its whispers. It never hurts me, only it works on me until I forget who I am.  But mostly, I feel it because I see its poison working its way out of me and on to those around me as repercussions of my actions. Scorn, mostly, well deserved, but scorn nonetheless. To whom it may concern:  Whether or not your actions are deserved of my contempt are unbeknownst to me, simply I am the messenger of voices I have held back far too long, voices that I believe to be true, and not voices of my own conception, these are other people I have held back again and again. The conflict has dissolved to loyalties now, truly; there can be no middle ground for you and I, make well known this, without someone else's dissention. Be aware that there was a reason for the things I have done, and a reason for why I keep you away now.  I have come to a point in life where there is a parting of paths, 'now that there is no good escape', the paths have forked, and now I sit at the crossing of the roads and wonder as to which I shall take now. And perhaps, to go back, and see how far I have come...or perhaps, not to go at all, as it seems to me that the agony is upon everyone else and not myself at this point...although the wolves stalk at the sun sets...or rather, I cannot stay in one place too long and be safe.  Over anything, I wish I could be the totally uncomplicated me, not this romantic prodigy, shaped by society and its nuances and projections of love, love, that tepid desire, oh greatest and most destructive creation of man, the want of other humans, that which finally did bring us out from shadow, the essence of love.  Love is actually not a human invention...the concepts behind it are, but as for the emotion, a product of (creation? evolution?) existence. And, sadly and sorrowfully, and especially for me, who would resist it as of now, it is inevitable.  And thus the sun sets on another age and my understanding of the nature of life goes blurry again, a wheel of color, and I, to focus on one color and see what it may bring, be it love, be it conflict with the world, be it conflict at home, be it the same color as before, and the story as of now continues, the neverending chronicles of a man stricken with nameless emotions that interferes with all that he does...or perhaps, a modified version of that tale, where he has control of his existence.  Sorry for all the symbolism, somehow it tends to well up in periods of intense thought, as I am having now, and later, when I read through all of this, I can at least make a bit of sense out of it.  Blurry, love, struggle, it all comes around.  Again, that is.    "

I had never seen such unconscious segregation until I moved there.  I am very happy to be further north now.  Remember also, Chris...that while Lott was attempting (poor thing) to cover his ass on BET (once again, having grown up in MS...BAAAAAHAAAAA!  you have no idea how funny THAT was for me)....he was asked why he voted against making MLK day a national holiday...and he responded by saying (this was voted on in 1983 or so, mind you) something to the effect of having not realized MLK's social-political-historical significance at the time.  What a jackass.  As for his future in the Senate, I don't really shive a git.  I don't live in MS anymore and am no longer directly affected by his decisions.  If government is what it was built to be, i. e. an accurate representation of its constituents, then Lott is a perfect representative for Mississippi and its beliefs.  So there ya go. I'm done.          ",

If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

Franklin pulled some shit in nine seconds. Everyone around me was saying, 'Hell no, Franklin will never do it.'   They missed the extra point, we got the ball first in OT. We were killed in the field goal, and then they kicked one and got it...their very first one of the night.  Everyone was clearly defined, teamwise, after the game. I was the one standing way up top giving Franklin the bird.   On the way out tho...I had calmed a bit. I was still fucking pissed off...hell, I still am. But I was cooling down, driving by the buses, giving the Franklin bandies the 'evil eye', which they returned and being pretty amicable, in general. And then, one of the buses starts up the chant, 'Bend over, Brentwood.'  Fuck, I dunno why, but that was the shortest straw. I think it's just the fact that they're a bunch of redneck assholes. Maybe some latent fear of being anally raped?!? But all the same, the window was down, and I made clear my feelings on that with a mid-based finger. Someone yelled, 'Franklin rules!' to which I yelled...something not very nice. I made up a lot of things too. I must give myself one thing, if not a lot of things: I am a proficient swearer. Tonite became the advent of so many interesting phrases, I could do verbal battle with a sailor and pwn his @zz.  So. I'm going to bed. Today was a really bad frickin' day, because it was raining. I ate lots of chocolate, but I guess the seratonin pumps decided not to work. David Stanley also made some pretty fucking horrible comments today about Abby...I'm playing football at his house on Monday. Rest assured he's going to fucking  die .

As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.

I think I was running on will power on the last couple of days since I came home and slept from 1am-11am and then 2pm-5pm...I think that's around 14 hours of sleep. I think I can honestly tell you all that I've never done that before. (Josh I now know the power of cherry coke=energy) Anyway I loved my roommates and I'm going to miss them, the randomness of our songs, the pregnancies and births, the veggie tales, the red-neckness, and the FON's/ DWH's. Ask me sometime what those means....each has a story that I don't have the coordination to type out but they are amusing to say the very least. I have a stalker and so did my roommate. I met some awesome guys and gals in my mission track team. I now have my own body guard that is HUGE...but he's in knoxville and he's also a youth leader. That came in handy when I told him that Fletch the stalker was being too friendly.  I think I'm going to try to get in touch with Cityteam...my favortie mission track. they're a drug rehab place for Chester. Chester was the good part of town to be in they it went down so now you can't walk outside after dusk or bad bad things happen. But i loved it. God's love was so alive there. Here in Brentwood it's common for people to take God's love taken for granted but the ones that were saved in Chester, they had suffered much but they also knew the greatness of God and they worshiped with a passion that I find lacking in Brentwood. I went to M-fuge to partly test my faith and see if I truly did believe...I found instead that passion for living in Christ that I've been lacking. Most don't know but I've been a christian ever since I was 7 but I drifted throughout intermediate and middle school. Those were horrible years so I've never told you before what happened then. If you guys really search, I don't think you'll ever find that I've really mentioned my middle school years beyond the fact that I hated them, I went to FMS, and I knew Arden and Christina. Becuase of those awful years I started at BBC and I have worlds of thanks to give them. I found a loving and supporting group where I did get to know Him more and now he's my Friend. I can't wait for school to start. I've failed so many times and yet he's still willing to see if my faith lasts and I pray that it will this time through out the school year and beyond. I love you all guys.       ",

The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.

The chorus says it all, 'it's in our nature to kill ourselves'. First utilized in a fit of extreme anger.    Hey Jealousy  by Gin Blossoms  Tell me do you think it'd be alright If I could just crash here tonight You see I'm in no shape for driving Anyway I've got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around  The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy Hey jealousy, hey jealousy, hey jealousy  And you can judge me not to think And not to sleep around And if you don't expect too much from me You might not be let down Cuz all I really want's to be with you Feeling like I matter too If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy Hey jealousy, hey jealousy, hey jealousy  Tell me do you think it'd be alright If I could just crash here tonight You see I'm in no shape for driving Anyway I got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I ever had If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone  Tomorrow we could drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take its place Hey jealousy  Hey jealousy Well she took my heart There's only one thing I couldn't start    Pertinence  : Firstly, the Blossoms put me in a good mood all the time, and secondly, the line 'If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago, I might be here with you' applied to my struggles with Leigh Anne, thinking that I was an asshole before and that's why she hated me now.    Sorrowful Farewell  by Rotting Christ  Counting the time Waiting for the crime A loss of innocence A faint reminiscence I am into a light Surrounded by the night Their memory's been disgraced The scene is still unchanged  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom, and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?  I keep still I'm trying to feel The hate that's within you I'm going to win you I was mistaken I was forgotten Unbroken silence Absolute violence  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?  The time is near The message is clear The battle will be fought Fight now, fear not  Counting the time Waiting for the crime A loss of innocence A faint reminiscence I am into a light Surrounded by the night Their memory's been disgraced The scene is still unchanged  I praise the song of defeat I am the bottom and he's the summit A sorrowful farewell Where does salvation, does salvation dwell?    Pertinence  : It was mostly a rocking song and I needed one badly at the time. The vocals suck ass, but they really preached to my anger. Also, the line 'I am the bottom and he's the summit', probably a reference to some demon in this case, spoke to me as, 'this is what you are, that is what you could be, this is how you can get there, and this is what it's going to take'.   For Whom The Bell Tolls  by Metallica  Make his fight on the hill in the early day Constant chill deep inside Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey On they fight, for they're right? Yes, but who's to say For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know Stiffened wounds test their pride Men of five still alive through the raging glow Gone insane from this pain that they surely know  For whom the bell tolls Time marches on For whom the bell tolls  Take a look to the sky just before you die It's the last time you will Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery Hears the silence so loud Crack of dawn all is gone, except the will to be Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see  For whom the bell tolls  Time marches on For whom the bell tolls    Pertinence  : None, really. I picked up  Ride the Lightning  at the middle/end of December, and listened to it again, it reminded of the severe but serene loneliness I had when I first started listening to Metallica, so what A GREAT IDEA listening to music that depresses us. YES.    All I Want  by Toad the Wet Sprocket  Nothing's so loud As hearing when we lie Truth is not kind And you said neither am I And the air outside so soft Is saying everything Everything  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks, I feel insane  Nothing so cold As closing hard when all we need is To free this hole But we wouldn't be that brave I know  And the air outside so soft Confessing everything Everything  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks, I feel insane  And it won't matter now Whatever happens will be For the air speaks of all we'll never be You won't trouble me  All I want is to feel this way To be this close, to feel the same All I want is to feel this way The evening speaks I feel insane To feel so close Let it take me in Let it hold me so I can feel insane    Pertinence  : One of the few songs I think as beautiful, this song. It's haunting. I listened to it a long time ago, picked it up again in mid-December. And 'You won't trouble me' was my favorite line when I started listening to it again, guess why...    Hold Me Down  by Gin Blossoms  So I guess I must have just been dreaming  When I thought I heard myself say no  Anyway it looks like no one heard me  So here I go  Cause when you're in the company of strangers Or just the strangers you call friends  You know before you start just how it's  Going to end   When the doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   I can't remember why I like this feeling  When it only seems to let me down  Soon I find I'm searching for the exit  From the ground  If I think the room is turning faster  Then I think the music is too loud  By then I've lived another broken story  To let me down   When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  When half the party moves into the bathroom  Hold me down  Or if you're at the tail end of the evening  And Dr. Feelgood comes around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down   Down if I want that part  Down if I've gone too far   Well I guess I must have just been reeling  When I felt myself begin to fall I realize I'm bounding down the hallways  And off the walls  If my bed was standing in the corner  I could just fall into it right now  And know that I'd just be staring at the ceiling  Going round   When those doors swing open  And all the drinks are passed around  Anytime the pickins look too easy  Hold me down  Down if I want that part Down if I've gone too far    Pertinence  : It's a happy song about drinking and partying. That's why it's so great. Picked up about the end of November, along with  Lost Horizons  and  Until I Fall Away .    Poem  by Taproot  Overbearing panic attack Entrenching my veins In an hour I'll be ok And pray this pain will go away Permanently someday  I've seen more than I should have to I've seen this on my own  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass And move on into your own Your own  Reoccuring drowning effect Entrench my brain I hope you'll be ok someday So I can say That you moved on in the right way  We've seen this and We've breathed this and We've lived this on our own  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own Your own, your own  Break  This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own This song is a poem to myself It helps me to live In case of fire Break the glass  And move on into your own Your own, your own, your own    Pertinence  : Well, their 'pain' sounds pop-theme inspired, and that's how I always felt mine was, just drawing off things I've seen. And that's why I connected with this song. Picked up at the first of January.    Died  by Alice in Chains  I could climb until I reached where angels reside Ask around to find out where the junkie apply You just up and left me on this rock all alone It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died  I could drop until I touched a sinister side Visit all attractions slipping back at a slide Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died You died You died Died Died You died You died  I could climb until I reached where angel reside I could drop until I touched a sinister side  Oh, my heart is tired of beating slow It's been deflating since you  Died Died  You died You died Died Died You died You died    Pertinence  : It's a cool song, it was the anthem of my headbangage at the beginning of August when all the weird stuff was happening. That was when the depresion first started, I think, and this song made it worse, but I listened to it anyway. And now's it just hardcore    Lost Horizons  by Gin Blossoms  The last horizons I can see Are filled with bars and factories And in them all we fight to stay awake  I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  She had nothing left to say So she said she loved me And I stood there grateful for the lie  I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  Turns summer trees to bones and ice Turn insect songs against the night With words we build and words we break I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves  Maybe I could use you To reassure myself I wouldn't wish this indecision On anybody else I'd drink enough of anything To make this world look new And when the sin smiles How can it be wrong  The last horizons I can see Are now resigned to memories I never thought I'd still be here today  I'd drink enough of anything To make myself look new again I'm drunk drunk drunk in the gardens and the graves    Pertinence  : Picked up the day before Thanksgiving, I was sitting there listening to this, driving by the Capitol park, and thinking, 'what the hell am I doing to myself', whereafter things worked out. I credit this song with the inspiration to say all the right things.    Until I Fall Away  by Gin Blossoms  I wanna tell if I am or I am not myself It's hard to know how far or if at all to go I've waited far too long for something I forgot was wrong  I don't know all the answers Things that I'll find Won't have it within the time But it's all that I'll have in mind  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away  My fear, pretend, that I'll never be in love again It's real to me, but not like these fools and not like this scene I won't find, or have it within the time  If it's all rusted and fade in the spot where we fell Where I thought I'd left behind And it's loose now but we could try  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away  When there's no good answer To those new questions Another personal disaster There's nowhere to go but down  Until I fall away That won't keep us waiting long  Until I fall away I don't know what to do anymore Until I fall away...    Pertinence  : UMMMM. Read the song again, please? Manic depressive central, holding on to a dream that's fading. Picked up at the same time as  Lost Horizons  and  Hey Jealousy , I actually did an acoustic cover of this song that turned out pretty good. The only song that ever puts my depression in words.    Chemical Tribe  by Jerry Cantrell  If I live so long To see 'em droppin' bombs Rather have you near Check out what comes after here Ah here What comes after here  Generation turned a chemical tribe Don't really care if we live or die Generation turned a chemical tribe It's a lie and it's no surprise, die  Let the black odds roll Why we can't tell Crawl inside Rolling over, is this hell? Is this hell?  Generation turned a chemical tribe Don't really care if we live or die Generation turned a chemical tribe It's a lie I can tell you why  No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Born in ending times Possibly more truth than fable  Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe Generation turned a chemical tribe It's alive, so say goodbye  No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Born in ending times Possibly more truth than fable No last supper rite Bitchslapped 'fore you reached the table Born in ending times Leaning more toward Cain than Able  Bitchslapped 'fore you reach the table Could it be more truth than fable?    Pertinence  : It's a really scary song. I was listening to it in those dark endless days in October or so, when we all went to Firehouse that one time, that was about when I was listening to it. And it was killing me because it made me feel like dying, and got me really afraid for some reason, but I could never put it down. And now it just sounds cool.    Dam That River  by Alice in Chains  I clothed you in the canyon I drowned you in the lake You would think that I would tremble Only thing I'd not embrace  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away  I pushed and then you stumbled I kicked you in the face You stared at me so humble Got to keep that killing pace  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away  I burned the place around you I hit you with a rake You piss upon my candle So proving you're a fake  Oh you couldn't dam that river And maybe I don't give a damn anyway So you couldn't dam that river And it washed me so far away    Pertinence  : A hard hitting song, it came to me at the midst of August when I started having problems with my parents. There's nothing like listening to this song and kicking your door in, which I did. Plus, the line 'You piss upon my candle'...wonder where I got it from now?    Mrs. Rita  by Gin Blossoms  I can see it in her letters On the paper with her pen Her response is getting stranger Think she's coming 'round again So tell me Mrs. Rita What's it say in my tarot Read my palm and tell me Why do lovers come and go  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's coming 'round again  Well I've been keeping myself busy With my books and with my tapes And everyday's much better Since I've slowed my drinking pace There's no swimmin' in the bottle It's just someplace we all drown And I lost myself in sorrow I lost my confidence in doubt  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again  Get in the car and drive to town Down the block and back around Pretending that she's there with me, we drive Gone forever  Well my patience keeps me plaintive My high hopes keep me alone My lover's will is shakin' I wish she would just come home So tell me Mrs. Rita What's it say in my tarot Read my palm and tell me Why do lovers come and go  Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again Is she comin' 'round for me once again Around, or was that the end and I just hope she's comin' 'round again  I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round I just hope she's comin' 'round    Pertinence  : When I started to figure out, 'hey, I dunno what it's like to love someone like this', this song came into play. Me wondering if I was doing anything right, and starting in on the depression again, looking for an answer when there isn't one.    I'm With You  by Avril Lavigne  I'm standing on a bridge  I'm waitin' in the dark  I thought that you'd be here by now  There's nothing but the rain  No footsteps on the ground  I'm listening but there's no sound   Isn't anyone tryin' to find me Won't somebody come take me home   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I dont know who you are  But I I'm with you   I'm looking for a place  Searching for a face  Is anybody here I know  Cuz nothing's going right  And everything's a mess  And no one likes to be alone   Isn't anyone tryin' to find me Won't somebody come take me home   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you   Oh, why is everything so confusing  Maybe I'm just out of my mind  Yea, yea, yea, yea, yeah   It's a damn cold night  Trying to figure out this life  Won't you take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I  I'm with you, I'm with you   Take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you, I'm with you  Take me by the hand  Take me somewhere new  I don't know who you are  But I I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you    Pertinence  : It's just a really peaceful song, the first time I heard it, it got stuck in my head. Yeah yeah, she's a poser, but the song is still nice. And I said it was going to go somewhere, I had a lot of space left over, so I stuck it in. Picked up about three days ago from this post.    Got Me Wrong  by Alice in Chains  Yeah, it goes away All of this and more of nothing in my life No color clay Individuality not safe  As of now I think you've got me wrong So I'm sure you run from something strong  I can't let go Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow Feel a tortured brain Show your belly like you want me to  As of now I bet you got me wrong So I'm sure we reach for something strong I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love That don't last forever Something's gotta turn out right  You, sugar taste Sweetness doesn't often touch my face Stay if you please You may not be here when I leave  As of now I think you got me wrong So I'm sure we reach for something strong I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long Wrong, innocence too far gone from love That don't last forever Something's gotta turn out right    Pertinence  : Well, this song is about me, I think. 'You've got me wrong', I think I was really misunderstood during the 'bleeding months', like why I was killing myself over shit that was well within my control. And 'reach for something strong', find another thing to solve my problems, like talking to others about it, to find that ultimate 'answer'. 'I can't let go'...:Individuality not safe'. A good summary of my changing personality during the last six months.   Happy Happy Joy Joy  by Wax  Happy happy joy joy...  Hello boys and girls, this is your old pal Stinky Whizzleteets, and this is a song about a whale! No! This is a song about being happy! That's right! It's the 'Happy Happy Joy Joy' song.  Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy joy  Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy joy Joy  Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy happy joy Joy  I don't think you're happy enough I'll teach you to be happy And I'll teach your grandma to suck eggs  Now, boys and girls Let's try again  You are granted that we're all liars The little critters of nature They don't know that they're ugly  That's very funny  Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy Happy happy joy joy joy  JOY Hey hey hey  Happy Joy Happy Joy Happy Joy  You are granted that we're all liars The little critters of nature They don't know that they're ugly  That's very funny  Happy Joy Happy, joy, happy Joy  Like a fly marrying a bumblebee I told you to shoot but you wouldn't believe me Why didn't you believe me? WHY? Why didn't you believe me? AUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH    Pertinence  : This is mostly for Kenzie, it's the funniest song ever. We were both sorta depressed and talking about cartoons, and I mentioned I had this CD with  Happy Happy Joy Joy  on it. So I went and got it, and listened to it...GOD. The end is the best part, the little 'AUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH' is quite possibly the greatest part of any song, ever. We listened to it about 130495243750475294 times and were feeling much better after it. Picked up at the midst of January.    My Solution  by Stranglebox  Asylum was the answer The opened doors and let me in And told me time was not unmaking  They told me I could finally win I seek now retribution Raised my eyes and then I saw The steel and lonesome of my prison Bang my head against the stone cold floor  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away  Silence now my reason I sat alone inside myself I gave the all that I had in me They stole my life and gave me hell Addiction was the cancer And God, the price I paid And slowly dying I surrendered My poisoned soul as it fades to gray  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away, yeah  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that there is no level plane My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away  Now that there is no good escape Now that there's nothing more than just walking far away Now that I've laid my life to waste My solution, sell my soul to the end and fade me away My solution, I'm gonna find out the only way to escape And my solution, that I break free from the cage    Pertinence  : Well, one part of the story is, I wrote it. And the other part is, it happened to me. This is the summary of rejection and depression throughout the span of these six months, and I called it  My Solution . It's about suicide, if you haven't noticed. Being trapped to one part of myself and finding no other way to leave it, knowing what is wrong for me, and doing it anyway. This is the song I wrote for just that, for just not making the cut, for just not being on the level to get what I wanted. And the only way to get myself away from it was to end myself.  The song was written in early September and finished in October or November. It took a few months of work to nail, and it was a really agonizing process. After that, we took a long break; we're back now recording  Little Rhyme , still getting it down, along with  Bitter  and  After Memory Has Faded . It should be finished sometime at the end of summer, there's going to be about a session a day then.  Don't ask how long this took. Suffice to say, HOURS.   Enjoy when you get it. I'll put a link in the template to this day so you can go back and read the lyrics in the future.  Whoo.    "

      "3": "             BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.    - Ted Rall           ",

Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).

It's on a notepad on my Internet-unready komputer in my room. Sadness.   Between Times  is the greatest song ever, I listened to it about a thousand times minus 998 this morning. And I also listened to  In Dominae Sathana , which is also a good song because of the really amazing guitar work. And  If It Ends Tomorrow , and the beginning of  The Fifth Illusion , heh. 'AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH,'...I listened to another on there, but I have since forgotten of the name of it, which is espekially gay when trying to put the names on a komputer database.   This day is just  unnatural , it's so good. Probably one of the best I've had in months. I got 100 on a geometry quiz, then I finished my homework in there, I got 100 on a biology quiz, I finished my homework in there, I got everything done for today in study hall, whikh is really happifying since I hardly ever do. Maybe that's the sekret to my depression, to finish all my homework  early  and not have any undue anxiety...  Nah.  A quikk random thing, the prinkiple of tires. Now, tires akt upon the funktion of gripping the road, mukh like a train grips the trakk. If you lose that grip (as I did during the last snow), there's no hope for you, exkept to hope to start gripping before you hit something. And in my case, I ran off the road. But that prinkiple of aktually holding to the road, as if we were on a trakk...awesome. And gay at the same time, I should know, since I did it, ran straight off the road, off a little hill. Some dudes kame and helped us push the kar out though, so it was ok.   Hope it keeps raining through the weekend, even though I'll be doing nothing at my dad's all that time, I enjoy the rain. Go listen to  Between Times  a few dozen times and drink some Kherry Coke and play EVO. Bones and ashes of my formerly komplicated life of talking on the phone konstantly.  Actually, I konsider this an evolution, since  while  being on the phone, I am also doing all these other things, NIK(C)E. Why kouldn't I see it before, exkluding my life from my sokiality probably would've ended me, had I not done something about it, which I did subkonkiously.

I will agree that she is not fat, but it is a comparitive tool.  I could just as easily use short and tall I suppose, but that is not a sure thing since one appears to be standing and the other is kneeling on an elevated platform (I think).

Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         ",

I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.

      "2": "           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             ",

      "4": "       Well, here I sit again.  'Uh oh' you say, you go and grab a drink because you know this is going to be one of  those . You sit back and stare blankly at the screen, letting a bit of spit fall from your open jaws as you sort through this post and get the message: 'I wanna bitch'. It's the same one tenfold, but for some reason there's something new to get out of it every time.  I'm not intending for this one to be long. Which means it probably will be.  I want you all to know, especially Lindsey, that you all did  not  screw up my life. Let me see if I can retell this plainly.  Leigh Anne called back shortly after Rosie to ask for Brittany's phone number. After a while she handed the phone to Lily. Lily's mom picked up and told her to get off because she needed to use it, whereafter she didn't use it. But anyway, Lily put down the phone and forgot about it.  Meanwhile, I set up this BLog and posted that one at the bottom in Kenzie's, where, shortly after, I deleted it, for reasons that will become apparent in a few lines here.  I had a silent line for 93 minutes before Lily noticed the phone off the hook and picked it up, whereupon she said 'Hello?' and I said, 'Umm...hi,'...there was a round of laughs, then Leigh Anne was inspired to talk to me and say that she was upset with me and didn't hate me anymore. After a minute, she told me they were setting up a tent and that she was going to go and help them. She was trying to get away from them for a second by locking herself in a closet or something, and I didn't think it worked, because she eventually gave in and just said, 'I love you,' and hung up.  So that was ULTRA cool for me. I went and played darts with my sister's friend who was staying over, I won.  They called back shortly after. There were a few more Iluvu's in there, there was some sappiness, which Leigh Anne alleged would happen, and then she hung up at about 1:30, whereafter, Lily tells me, they went to sleep.  So the next day I guess Leigh Anne was still like that for a while. Things went bad at about 5 that evening. They got worse at 6:30. Then I went to my dad's house feeling generally pissed at my dying fortune.  And then that night she just asked me to forget about it again. That she wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone, that she needed a friend. There are some other things that were more personal when we were together that came up, but they eventually were also rescinded until there was nothing left but a big fuckin' gap of silence, whereafter I put down the phone and read your posts. I had said no arguing, I felt like there was some here, so I just decided to call the other people off. Plus Rosie's  ultimately  childish post of 'Joah...God I hate you.' As if I needed anymore of that stuff.   I posted it to see whom of you would stick by me no matter what. It really seems though, now that I look at it, that Rosie was reallllllllllyyyyy eager to give up on me...some friend :), well we've got things straightened out for the most part.  Then I woke up the next morning and felt stupid because I really enjoy the outside input at times, so I went back on it but it was a little too late for that. So today in fourth I answered Lily's post for the most part(there's more answers for her and Lindsey after this one, by the way), and I resent an invitation to join the BLog since Lindsey had backed out and was mad at me.  So that is the story. Last night things were pretty good for a while. But I really don't care. Actually, at one point, Leigh Anne had this horoscope thing on her cell and was telling me to think of a question and tell her...at one of them I just said, 'Can I just keep it in my head?' and she said ok, and the real question was, 'Will things ever work out with me and her?', and the VERY astonishing answer was a bunch of star alignment bullshit followed by the interpretation, 'Give it time and it will work in the near future,'. I was like, WHOA. She asked what the question was and I was too stunned to think for a second. Then I said something about if I was going out to eat or not that day.  She always thinks of something bad when I'm making her laugh, and she bring it up, after which it'll be a thorn in my side and I really can't be humorous anymore and she'll start talking about all these guys...I swear to god, this girl has no female friends, and the ones that could be considered so, she can't connect with them, or they're lesbians and they're after her.  So that's about it for now, that's the story so far.  Fucking story.     "

Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.

Well...there's no one online at the moment...the usuals that I can't exert any social talents on, the robots, the people that I'm just not going to give an SN to right now because I don't want to face up to what they have to say at the moment. So I thought I would just come in and make me a nice little BLog right quick.  So lately I've been playing the role of psychologist, and I must say...it's really weird. I don't know where it comes from but it does, like a little river it flows right out until it's coming like a torrent. The silence thereafter is one of bliss...it's the satisfaction that I got to the core of some long hidden or ne'er disclosed truth.  There was a few days after it first happened when I had to come to grips with myself after feeling that 'unnamed feeling' for the first time, and being able to deal with the fact that I just knew these things, and that I didn't have to know where they were coming from. It was hell, it was feeling hopelessness for just a few hours. And then something clicked when I was talking to Rosie one day, and that little lightbulb just clicked on, and suddenly it doesn't feel that bad anymore, it doesn't seem like I'm entirely helpless, and that I may not be god of the universe, but if I can put a bright spot in someone's day once, that spot can grow and multiply. It's like planting a tree in an empty field.  In other news....I GOT ONE OF MY MICS THE OTHER DAY! w00t! So I have the guitar mic with which I recorded  Master of Puppets ...at least, some of it. DEAR LORD. It sounds so much better than plugging straight in with the POD like I have been doing, not so low end and muddy. So now...have to record all the demos AGAIN. But it's ok because I've grown to love recording. And this time we've been offered some help with the process which would be very nice...Abby already knows how to work the damn thing and that's awesome. So maybe she'll do it and then I'll cry because the recordings will sound even BETTER! Because I won't have to reach for the buttons and cause excess noise when I don't want to. Allz I have to do is twist, plug, and play. JOY! Of course, that is assuming Abby even reads this...I wonder.  Rosie thinks I look....'cute'.....with my little streaked blonde hair bit after getting some sun. Um, well, if she says so. Personally it just makes me look...gay. It's my duty to the world to keep up my facade of darkness and melancholy, and that blondeness just puts a few key dents in the gloomy shell. But I want to get a bit of a tan too so as to not look...so pasty? Sunless tan, here we come.   People are odd.   Well some people, at least. We all get divided into our own categories.  It's a really nice night. Go outside tonite everybody, it's really nice.    "

Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

Also, note that democracy emerged from pagans, not from Hebrews.  If one shouldn't burn the flag, can one burn a copy of the Constitution?  Or the Declaration of Independence?  Should one not throw a flag away?  How about cutting it?  Or placing it in acid?  Should one not discard it out the window of a car?  Should one not draw on it?  What if I draw on a painting of a flag?  Is a painting a flag?  Or is it only cloth?  Does plastic count?  Does it have to be a rectangle?  What of flag bookmarks?  Flag shot glasses?  Flag shirts, socks, hats?  What if I am angered by the discovery of something horrible that my country sanctioned, and I want to remove the flag sticker from my car -- should I wait until I've calmed down, so the act of disposing of the flag sticker won't be soiled by my mood at the time?  Here's a quandary:  All the people protesting in Great Britain today are encouraging those who committed the latest bombings in Turkey.  *Even* if they honestly don't think they're doing so!  Conundrum Corner indeed!  yelahneb:  If Iraqis feel that they can bicker amongst themselves, but if someone tells them what to do, they want none of it.  In America, that feeling is a source of pride.  Yet we disregard Iraqis who feel that way.  Ironic, no?  The current anti-war movement lacks focus, and has not yet produced a clear thesis.  I realize it *thinks* it has, and I acknowledge the thrill and glee of joining a movement, however vague its nature -- but I have yet to hear a clear, compelling manifesto.  Which is a shame, because for all the effort it takes to make and topple a statue, it means nothing without a meaningful message.  I'm sold on the fad, but not the thinking.  A question to the Left:  Assuming that you are correct, that the war was misguided (and I am inclined to agree, to a point), what will it take for the 'movement' to move into the present situation?  Protesting a war that has already happened seems rather silly.  What is the goal -- to get a leader elected who will pull everything *out* of Iraq immediately?  Surely it would be clear to a careful observer that the resulting vacuum would be even worse.  Given that -- what is the *present* strategy of the Left?  What should be done with the *current* situation?  A complete pullout?  Half?  What, exactly?  Assuming the war was wrong -- what should be done *now*?  Assuming our election was a fraud -- what should be done *now*?  Protesting occurs in the present.  Once the protested event is past, the act becomes whining.  An unfortunate, but honest truth.  What do we do *now*?  -- Nonaffiliated But Engaged in Virginia         ",

    "query_text": "              Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            ",

I thought it was mono round 2 at first...the hot-cold spells, the feeling of parasite heat in my brain, the hallucinations (and yesterday I had some good ones, my dad was FREAKED)...but I'm getting better pretty fast so I don't think it's mono. Altho the letters are coming on the screen a lot slower than I'm typing them...actually, the whole world is kinda moving in slow motion right now so that might mean a new wave.   Rosie, I noticed you called earlier. I've been sleeping most of the day, I was asleep then, but you'll be happy to know that the phone ringing was incorporated into one of the most [sic] and twisted dreams I've ever had. I don't remember what it was, I just remember jerking awake and scaring the cats when I yelled.   Speaking of remembering stuff...I don't really remember today at all. I don't remember yesterday. That must mean the acetominophen is wearing off, cuz I can feel that little buzz of fever coming back in. I'm going to cry. I hope I didn't pass this to Abby, whatever it is.  I tried cooking yesterday...that was when the first hallucination hit. And since then I've pretty much been a vegetable, eating oatmeal-raisin cookies (my second fav, next to peanut butter) and watching  BUFFY: THE FOURTH SEASON  on DVD. That show is really badass. Altho I finished it today so now I have nothing to do.  And of course...Abby is gone until after school starts, and that's making me a very weepy chimp...but I have pictures now!, so that's a bit of a bonus. But I'm still a weepy little chimp. Alex is gone until the fifth, so no sessions, but I am going to do some recording when I get better. Brooks, whom I've been playing CS with a lot lately, is about to leave for la Floride...and I yelled at him today for calling back two hours after I told him that I was really sick and needed to get some sleep. He called again and I hung up on him...I think he got the point now.   Sorry for talking so much, everyone. I'm desperate for company but I'm not very pleasant in the conversation department right now...so I'm probably going to isolate myself until I get better. So if I don't answer posts/the phone in the next few days, you'll know why.  Well, my dad's back with some more White Cranberry-Strawberry Cocktail stuff now (it's the best Brand-X juice in the universe...on sale at Kroger   NOW  !!!!) so I'm going to go down some and try to get some more sleep.  Until we meet again.    "

      "2": "           The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  full article from the ny times :   House Approves Domestic Security Bill By DAVID FIRESTONE  ASHINGTON, Nov. 13  The House hurriedly approved a revised domestic security bill tonight to reflect a new agreement with the White House on reducing worker protections, brushing aside Democratic objections that Republican leaders had added several provisions benefiting businesses and Republican interests.  The bill, approved 299 to 121, would reverse an earlier measure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department. It would also extend protection against liability suits for airline screening companies and many other businesses that contract with the department, and adds a similar provision protecting the makers of smallpox vaccines.  Most Democrats voted against the bill, with many raising objections to the new provisions and the altering of Civil Service rules.  The House voted 215 to 203 along party lines not to create an independent commission to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. Several members of both parties in the two chambers said they would try to include the commission in an intelligence spending bill that has still not been passed. But Republican House leaders said the commission needed more planning, drawing complaints from relatives of attack victims that they were trying to hide failures that might have prevented the attacks.  Working to conclude the year's legislative business by week's end, the House also passed a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating through January. Many members of both parties had hoped the House would pass at least a few of the pending appropriations bills the government uses to keep operating, but House leaders said they would take up the bills once the new Congress convened next year.  As expected, Republican House members elected Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, formerly the majority whip, to the new post of majority leader in the next session.   Democratic House members are scheduled to conduct their leadership elections on Thursday, and are likely to choose Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, now the minority whip, as their leader.  This morning, however, a new candidate for the job emerged, demonstrating the continuing disagreements among Democrats over how to respond to their losses in last week's elections. Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio said she would run for the position to draw votes from members who object to Ms. Pelosi's emphasis on fund-raising.  'We will never raise more money than the Republicans  never,' said Ms. Kaptur, who is known for her opposition to free-trade measures and federal funding for abortions. 'We must elevate the non-money wing of the Democratic Party and create populist symbols to convey our message.'  Ms. Kaptur joins Harold E. Ford Jr. of Tennessee in contesting the Democratic leadership election, for which Ms. Pelosi claims to already have sufficient support to win.  In the Senate, Republicans chose Trent Lott of Mississippi to be the majority leader in the next term, along with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as majority whip and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona in the third-ranking job of leading the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Lott said after today's election that Republicans would focus on national and economic security, mentioning specifically a prescription drug program for low-income older people and making individual retirement accounts easier to use.  Senate Democrats also held their leadership elections today, unanimously choosing Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota as chairman of the caucus, along with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Mr. Daschle will be minority leader in the next Senate, Mr. Reid will be minority whip.  Senators also voted 58 to 36 not to block their annual pay raise, which would increase their salaries by 3.1 percent to $154,700 to $150,000 next year. Passage of an energy bill was deferred until next year because of continuing partisan disagreements over regulation and conservation.  The Senate began a lengthier process of approving the domestic security bill, which is expected to pass as early as Friday.  Senators showed that they remained closely divided on the bill, deciding 50 to 47 to drop the Democratic version of the bill on a closely watched test vote. The new version of the bill will have enough votes for passage, but many Democrats remain upset that President Bush won virtually his entire plan to cut back on civil service protections for workers, making it easier to fire and transfer them.  Many Democrats in both chambers were furious today when they read the fine print of the new version of the bill and found that Republicans had inserted provisions that had not been discussed in the six months of debate on the antiterrorism department, or that had been cut in the Senate bill.  The new language, for example, allows the administration to reorganize the department after it is created, differing from the Senate Republican version that would require congressional approval of a reorganization. It revises a provision, passed 318 to 110 in July, that prohibited contracts with offshore tax-evading companies, allowing the department to waive the ban in the name of saving American jobs.  The bill would allow immunity from liability for companies that make faulty antiterrorism devices or technology, and would make it difficult to sue companies that make smallpox vaccinations if the vaccines cause illness.  In one last-minute addition, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, inserted a provision that was apparently intended to protect Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical giant, from lawsuits over thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative that some parents contend has caused autism in their children.  'I'm really quite surprised they would put in the fine-print provisions we never saw in any other versions, that never even went through committees,' said Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.'  But Republicans, like Representative William M. Thornberry of Texas, said the additions were minor and paled next to the importance of creating a department to protect the nation's safety.               ",

His face started to itch all over.  He began scratching his face.  Repeatedly.  It started to sting, and he began to notice blood on his fingernails.  His face was in pain, yet still itching badly.  So he kept scratching.  Eventually he passed out.  Some hours later he awoke.  His face felt sore, but it was no longer itching.  He examined his hands; they were bloody.  He stood up and went to the mirror.  His face looked terrible.  There were multiple gashes on his face.  He went to the bathroom and washed his hands and face.  It looked as though he had lost a fight with a cat.  How was he going to explain this to everyone?  Would they consider him weird?  Unfortunately this was something he could not hide.

Check this out, excerpted from a spot in the NY Post yesterday:   January 8, 2002 -- CNN yanks 'sexy' Paula spot    IN a wacky attempt to stave off the ratings onslaught of rival Fox News Channel, CNN went bonkers over the weekend by shamelessly promoting mother-of-three anchor Paula Zahn as 'sexy.'   Media-watchers were startled when a racy commercial for Zahn's show, 'American Morning with Paula Zahn,' ran on CNN over the weekend.   'Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart, oh, yeah, and just a little sexy?' a male announcer asked during the 20-second spot. The word 'sexy' flashed in red letters and an image of the well-coiffed blond anchor popped up on screen.   The ad was pulled yesterday morning. Walter Isaacson, chairman and CEO of CNN's Newsgroup, groaned in a statement: 'It was a major blunder by our promotions department.

He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",

But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this               ",

It's like looking at yourself in the mirror times 119283740293475912437, but if you look too long you get a little self-concious.   Listening to  So Low  right now. Yes, it's a bit late for such things, but I had lots of coffee...sorry Abby! What else is there, besides beer? Which I'm probly about to imbibe, anyway. And then there's sewage water and that's pretty much it.  I talked to my cats in a Sean Connery voice about the importance of the grilled chesse sammich, and how I was the master, yet still in training by my forefathers, those lonely old bastards cooped up in apartments, very single and very unconcerned, sometimes drunk for days and having a hankering for food, and what do they make, but grilled chesse and tomato soup? And what should I do but screw up BOTH. You wouldn't think so but I CAN. I'm good at screwing that stuff up. But then I had horrible canned stew after which...made up for it? And white chocolate raspberry ice cream, which I have finally all-consumed. That's it, no more good food. I'm screwed. I'm out of ideas.   So...  So...  This is my first good caffeine trip in a long time, and somehow, BLogging is so much more enjoyable here, in this little glow of insanity, sitting here doing nothing but thinking about consumption and what a bastard I am.   Lindsey knows all the devious plans now. War har har. PLEASE don't tell, PLEASE? It's a surprise and all. It's bad enough with her little convincing smile and pathetic voice, every inch of my being wants to surrender but I CANNOT! So please don't tell. Ok, I know you won't but I'm just making sure.   Ugh. It's been a couple hours since I started this. Presently, I'm working on the CD. It doesn't have nearly as many tracks as I promised, but there's some stuff that no one's heard, older stuff, and some special commentaries!!! Three songs that are newish.  Let Me Go ,  Close My Eyes , and  So Low . And I think  Rhyme  is gonna be on there, an early bass cut of  Close My Eyes , and little snippets of experiment songs called  Down  and  Scarecrowman . And commentaries! From me! I'm so dumb. But I think you all will like it. I know your up to your asses in  Broken Me  and since I deleted it, it's pretty much not going on there, unless someone can get me a copy soon. And only one person has the original cut of  My Solution  on CD anymore. But that's ok. You guys are sick of those, I know. I made such a big deal out of them and now it's all over.  Whatever. My breath reeks of disfermented hopps and I'm making CDs like crazy. I have my little case here, and if one of these happen to have either of the two glory boys on it, you all will be first to know. I'm just going to leave this post as is, fo shieezey. I'll be back in a few minutes.  HAHA I found a copy of  Broken Me . Woot, it's going on there next.  Ok so...the tracklist so far...  1. Introduction 2. So Low 3. Goodbye My Friend 4. Let Me Go 5. Enjoying the CD? 6. Broken Me 7. My Solution (acoustic) 8. Down (demo cut) 9. Scarecrowman (demo cut) ( very  incomplete) 10. Little Rhyme 11. Bass riff (early  Close My Eyes  demos) 12. Until I Fall Away (cover) 13. That's all! 14. Close My Eyes  This CD is sounding good. I just finished remixing  Down ...it turned out really good for having four parts in it. And I left one intelligible line in at one point, so you all get to hear what it might have sounded like. WOOT. Time to mix  Scarecrowman  and make it sound like I wasn't playing with the damned riff for the first time that day...which I was...it was the same day I got the recorder. I recorded  Scarecrowman  and  Goodbye My Friend  for the first time.     Memories  ....  Wow...I didn't remember, but I gave up on trying to coordinate the guitar parts on  Scarecrowman  without drums so I started soloing...it sounds mostly the same, or bad...but there's this one place where it sounds fraggin' AMAZING! I'm letting it master itself right now...  Right...just a few more to go. I'm going to start a lyrics booklet that I'll email, including the deleted lyrics, even the ones to the cover. And a transcript of what I'm saying during the little retarded commentaries. But not the subliminal messages. I mean, what good are subliminal messages if you know what they're saying? Duh!  Beer tastes awful, but I'm thirsty. I could never be an alcoholic. I dunno what my dad sees in this shit. Gross.  Here's the boring part. Waiting for  Little Rhyme  to burn itself. God...every time me and Alex play this, we both look at each other and groan and say, 'this so is sooooooooooo long!' and then we play it, because we always do, right after  Broken Me  and followed by  My Solution . We're beasts in those sessions. Alex kills himself trying to doublebass and I just kill myself jumping off of things, hitting my head on things, throwing things, yelling things, screaming all the lines of the song, saying them backwards, saying them in Arameic while doing a handstand, smoking a hashpipe, and playing my guitar which is somehow infested with a swarm of killer bees. This friends...is the part of the evening where the caffeine wears off and the alcohol kicks in.  As you all know, I have no alcohol tolerance whatsoever. And while this is a nonalcoholic beverage, it can't help but have a bit in it, because of the nature of its production. It has less than NyQuil in it. However, I have no tolerance, and were I to finish this bottle I might be a bit drunk, and me drunk...that's a bad thing. I'm either tired or depressed, or sometimes I say really funny things and start crying about them. This is another reason why I will never be an alcoholic.  I just heard a pop. That means  Rhyme  is done.   The bass riff is done. It's pretty shaky at the end cuz I forgot the main riff. But you'll get a good glimpse into where the riff for  Close My Eyes  came from. Damn...that was a rough song. It took most of the year to work out the perfect words. And the music was impossible. So one day I heard this riff in storage, and something clicked and I nailed it.  Close  is the last song on this record by the way.  Pop.   Until I Fall Away ...I haven't listened to that track since Christmas, when I recorded it...or thereabouts. It's a Gin Blossoms song, probly my fav of theirs...3 on  New Miserable Experience ...if you haven't heard of the Blossoms, I really suggest them. They don't sound anything like my music, but they're incredible musicians and songwriters, and they're coming to Georgia and bygod if I'm not going to see them. They're from Tempe, Arizona...that's where we're gonna be, along with Tuscon and Phoenix in a few weeks, so I get to visit the home of the Blossoms! And get some Coodukx shakes that Abby was talking about...heheh...I can't remember the real name of that place anymore....Iji, I think it was....Captain Iji? I dunno, it sounds pretty close. I'm plastered. Pop.  The outro is done, and now the last and awesomeest song.  Here I go.  Alright kids. It's burning, but I'm gonna go now and as soon as it's done, I'm going to listen to it and cry. And then, I'm going to burn all of you copies of this wonderful endeavor, and I sincerely hope you enjoy.  Starting on the lyrics booklet/notes thing.  Ciao for now, friends.      "

    "query_text": "            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          ",

      "0": "              A Day With Low Seratonin, A Day With Self-Injury   I guess some may look at the title and be puzzled.  When I recently saw my psychiatrist, he increased the amount of Lexapro I'm to take, so that I'll have more seratonin in my brain, which will help offset the OCD-type symptoms (read: self-injurious behavior, mainly picking at scabs to make them bleed).  These symptoms have been aggravated by the Adderall, which I'm taking for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  I've seen the Adderall help in my ability to focus my attention when and where I want it, but I still haven't stopped the picking behavior.  I regret that I didn't immediately get the prescription filled when I got it over a week ago (Procrastination is classic ADHD behavior, by the way.).  This past Thursday I took the last dose of the medicine from the old prescription, and as of yesterday I still hadn't filled the new prescription.  So I didn't take my Lexapro last night, which means that all day today, I've been without the seratonin to help offset the picking behavior.  So I picked at scabs today.  A lot.  I currently have several on my upper right arm, the outside part that faces those to my right.  They were initially acne-type 'things' that I'd tried to 'pop.'  Eventually I just decided to start scratching.  In addition, I have some scabs on my left leg, just above the ankle but below the calf.  These I got from getting bitten by a mosquito or something.  It is interesting for me to say all of this because it was just a few days ago that I'd remarked to Jennie while we were in the car that I'd been feeling less of a desire to pick at my scabs.  I told her I didn't know if it was the medicine that was working, or if I'd just gotten bored of doing it, or what.  Then today happens.  I'm tempted to be very hateful of myself and to lash out at myself with words.  I realize consciously that that is not effective.  Fortunately for me, Jennie had the prescription filled today, and I've since taken my dose for tonight.  She's also put some vitamin E on the scabs to help them heal.  I usually put hydrogen peroxide on them to help prevent infection, but I noticed this morning that we were out.  Tomorrow is another day, thankfully.           ",

The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.

According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article   here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.

Show me the money!  Do you know where every cent is spent?  Money doesn't grow on trees, you know!  Spare no expense in getting your personal finances in order.  Here are a few tips:   Time is money.   In your planning device, schedule a daily or weekly appointment with yourself to balance the books.  This is a good time to identify spending patterns and make necessary corrections.  Budget constraints.   Set up a monthly budget and stick to it.  There are great computer programs like Quicken&copy; and Microsoft&copy; Money that'll do most of the work for you.  Remember to include savings and a personal budget for you and only you.  Adjust as you go.   Don't throw in the towel when your budget's in the red.  It's an indication that you may be living beyond your means in some areas, and adjustments should be made (or else it's time for a raise)! Controlling personal finances -- common cents.

Clarifying expectations in your family, work, and other relationships will help avoid misunderstandings, disappointments, and lack of trust.   Implicit vs. explicit.   Some expectations in relationships are implicit, like your boss expecting you to be at work on time.   Yet, many expectations are explicit, requiring further clarification.  Negative situations are created when you assume your expectations are self-evident and clearly understood by others.  Speak up.   In new relationships, get all the expectation out on the table at the beginning.  Clearly articulate who does what.  Almost all relationship difficulties are a result of ambiguous expectations around roles and goals.  Time and effort.   It's easy to pretend differences don't exist and to hope things will work out.

It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!          ",

I got pissed off so I wrote this song There's no new words so sing along Can you say 'fuck'? Can you scream real loud? Cuz if you can do that, then you know just how Grandma's in the kitchen makin' s'ghetti and meatballs A little Taiwanese kid just learned how to fly And everybody's story is a story to beat all So here comes the chorus, and you can't beat mine  Half-past the cynical, borderline sarcastic Welcome to the chorus where it all comes back Maybe feign political, really self-slapstick This doesn't make sense, but you already knew that  So here goes the part where I first say 'fuck' But if you've already heard us, then fuck stuff I don't have another Top 40 coming up any time And it's by the grace of God that I can even still rhyme Every motherfucker hearing 'fuck', and going crazy I bet you'd fucking like it if I yelled some fucking more This might be the fucking greatest you've heard maybe But all I fuckin' know's, it's making my throat sore   Chorus   The End! And another. Ok, so the song is called  Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue) , but it isn't about sniffing glue...even tho it actually comes out and says that. It's more about wanting to be killed and stay a kid than to grow up and be everyone's bitch, and glue is the proposed remedy.   When last I checked, 'fuck' was used very interestingly in this song, and without frugality. It's another pop-punk song, hence the excessive use of 'fuck' and other four-letters. So lessgo!! w00tw00t!!!111oneone   Braincells (I Wanna Sniff Glue)  by Stranglebox  You tell me I am gonna be A really big star if I can be A superman, everything and more Than I am All society has pressured me To go and take a stand Where I cannot I make a lot of mistakes And more than half the time I'm on a repeat anyways I'm not gonna learn a stupid motherfucking thing So would you please shut the fuck up And go the fuck away  You have told me a thousand times But I never really seem to change I haven't got a reason or rhyme Cuz all I fucking feel is shame So let's cut the bullshit and get to the heart And that way we can find a real place to start Yeah, I don't really know about a thing you do Cuz all's I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (Hooah!!)  You talk about how great I am When I'm watching it So would you understand when I Say that I can't take anymore The teams ain't fucking fair And I'm the one with the losing score Gonna kill me a bunch 'o braincells Cuz all the bullshit that was simple's On a downslide to hell It's ok if I am only talking about  Fucking up, but when I do it Then it's time to throw me out   Chorus  Lude  Chorus  Yeah, I don't really know But hell if anybody knew Cuz all I really fuckin' know is: I wanna sniff glue (YEEAAAAH!!!)  That stuff after the chorus in parenthesis is really in the song, it's a great one!!! This is the ultimate 'Fuck conformity!!!' Anthem right here.   Hmm...looking thru Ye Olde Booke Ofe Notese, I want to post a more serious one. I've written a thousand since I started in on the demos. With such titles as  Norm Bakerton the Monkey Shit Shoveller ,  Cacophony ,  Churn ,  Grave  (which is actually going on the demo once we get it all down pat.....IF we do), and... Slump . I might as well.  It might take some thinking to figure out the last line of the chorus...sort of open to interpretation, but I'm sure you all could get something out of it.   Slump  by Stranglebox  I woke up early Saturday morning smelled like rain and Feeling blown and surly I thought tomorrow would hurt like hell I hope that I'm not right.....as I open my eyes  I took my time I drank a Coke and swallowed memories I lost the rhyme The reason soon thereafter followed I sink into a wall.....you're up, but nature says you fall  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use some new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  I waited outside Cold as hell the street was frozen I smiled as it shined And knew how quick it'd kill me If I gave it one quick try.....cuz it only lives to die  The drive was cold, it was 6 PM, December 21 And ten more days, I know Will be a new year, this has been The worst one of my life.....it sucks, but it burns to go outside  Oh, it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the time, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all  (little 'lude)  Oh it wasn't right, I wish I knew half the tiem, I'm just Stupid, slumped, and fried, and I Could use a new life, because After all's not all... And after all's not all (repeat)  I've become a really odd songwriter lately. I don't write in any given time period (granted,  Slump ), I just write a whole lot of really really bipolar stuff. Sigh...sometimes it sucks to be on the craaazy side of the lefty fence.  And by the way...Jsoh? Can that even be pronounced?    "

I reported this accident to the manager, and she completed some paperwork after we closed last night.  After I'd reported it to her, she asked if I needed to go to Urgent Care (an after-hours clinic).  I told her that I felt I would be okay.  A little while later, while cleaning the grill (part of the closing routine), I burned my right index finger.  The pain was so acute that, along with the previous incident, I cursed and threw the utensil I'd been using, ripping off the latex gloves I was wearing as I headed toward the employee restroom to douse my right hand with cold water.  I wanted and needed the privacy because I was so upset.  I feel that the franchise owners do not convey an attitude that promotes safety.  There are management inconsistencies in this area as well as in other areas of the business.  Everyone has things that they value and desire when it comes to a job or a career.  Two of mine are  The company strives to live within its values and mission Every employee can be made to feel that he or she can make a difference Some coworkers asked me if I was okay after the burn incident.  I replied, 'No.  I'm pissed off.'  I feel like I've lost my heart for this job.  I definitely don't feel like giving more of myself to this company, and looking for extra ways to make it successful, if I'm not feeling like I'm that important to them.  I came home tired and upset.  Jennie and I talked, and I was so worked up that I had a hard time relaxing to fall asleep.  I needed to pray, so we did.  I don't want to work at a place where my wife is wondering whether I'll be able to come home in the same condition as I was when I left.  My feet have been hurting, too, from all the time I've spent over the years standing on my feet.  I suppose it's a chronic problem, but the pain has become more acute as of late.  Jennie recently saw a podiatrist about her feet, and I made an appointment to see someone from the same office for tomorrow morning.  I also contacted our family doctor to schedule and appointment related to my injury last night.  He doesn't see patients for work-related injuries, and his receptionist referred me to an occupational health clinic that does.  I made an appointment to see them for tomorrow afternoon.  I'm still feeling some pain in my right hand, elbow, and hip.  I also am feeling some pain on the right side of my back.  The power is still of at our place, by the way.  Jennie deposited my paycheck from last Friday into the bank on Saturday.  I had expected to make a cash withdrawal for an amount to take to the utility company's pay agent so that we could get the power back on today.  I found out after waiting in line at the bank, that the deposit had not gone through yet.  The teller said that it would post to our account this evening.  As I drove home, I wept and prayed, 'God, I don't even know what to pray for anymore.  It seems that there is so much that we need, and I know that you know what we need even before we ask.'  I'm tired.  I want all of this to be over.  I prayed last night that God would somehow take Jennie, Keisha, and I up to heaven so that we could be with him.  I feel like our lives would be so much better than the state where we are now.         ",

'This is Paddy, down at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!'  'Well, Paddy,' Saddam replied, 'this is indeed important news! How big is your army?'  'Right now,' said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, 'there is myself, my cousin Sean, my next door neighbor Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!'  Saddam paused. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command.'  'Begorra!', said Paddy. 'I'll have to ring you back!'  Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!'  'And what equipment would that be, Paddy?' Saddam asked.  'Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.'  Saddam sighed. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1 and a half million since we last spoke.'  'Saints preserve us!' said Paddy. 'I'll have to get back to you.'  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. 'Mr. Hussein, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Pub have joined us as well!'  Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. 'I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!'  'Holy Mary, and Joseph!', said Paddy, 'I'll have to ring you back.'  Paddy called again the next day. 'Top o' the mornin,' Mr. Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war.'  'I'm sorry to hear that,' said Saddam. 'Why the sudden change of heart?'  'Well,' said Paddy, 'we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and decided there's no way we can feed two million prisoners.'         ",

So, um, that's really all I have to say, except that I hate choir, and I know Z is going to kill me for that, but that's how I feel.  I'm supposed to come home and take a nap everyday, but choir is definitely cutting in to that.  Oh, and the fact that we kind of got in a wreckish type thing today.  Since you're all dying of suspense, I'll tell you the story.  Lindsey Baylor, the girl that chauffers me back and forth from school, skipped 7th period today to go fill up with gas. On her way back into the parking lot, people were double parallel parked, and she thought she had enough room to get through, but unfortunately, she didn't.  Her rearview mirror smashed into her her passenger side window (where I would have been sitting, had I decided to skip with her) and the glass shattered all over, so we spent until almost 4:00 vacuuming out her car, and there are still glass shards in there (and embedded in my arms too, I might add) but it's better than it was. So, that is my only happy story for today.  Call if you want a sad one...heehee.  I don't have a sad one to give today.  Sorry. Oh, and for the people who know about the whole cousin (Megan) situation, she's probably back home now, but I can't be sure on that.  She added me to her buddy list, and since she didn't have a computer at her boyfriend's house, I'm assuming she's back home.  But you never can tell with her... My thought was that maybe she was at the library, but then it hit me.  This is Vinemont Alabama.  There ARE no libraries... So, I'm guessing she's home. TTFN (Ta-Ta For Now.) That's what my orthodontist tells me all the time.  He's so cute. (Like old man with baby-face cute, not like hot cute.)      "

But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.

She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.

But you did get home, and everything is good, so I'm shutting up for now and going to post of your blog because the last post was almost a week ago and it's getting lonely.      ",

This is (could be, who knows) an actual letter sent to a man named Ryan  DeVries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, State of  Michigan.   Wait till you read this guy's response!   SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County Dear  Mr.  DeVries:   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that  there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of  property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor  who did the following unauthorized activity:   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream  of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A  review of the department's files shows that no permits have been issued.  Therefore, the department has determined that this activity is in violation  of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and  Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being  sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compile Laws, annotated.   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially  failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream  locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and  cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist  all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow  condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream  channel.   All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2002.   Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a  follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply  with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result  in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate  and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.   Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.   Sincerely, David L.  Price, District Representative Land and Water Management  Division ___________________________________________________   This is the actual response sent back:   Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County.   Dear Mr.  Price,   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson,  Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of  constructing and maintaining two wood 'debris' dams across the outlet stream  of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their  dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their  skillful use of nature building materials 'debris.' I would like to challenge  your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any  place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no way you could  ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity,  their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.   As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first  fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.  My first dam question to you is:   (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers?  or, (2)  do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam  request?   If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the  Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other  applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if  there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the  Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the PublicActs  of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws,  annotated.   I have several concerns.  My first concern is - aren't the beavers entitled  to legal representation?  The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute  and are unable to pay for said representation- so the State will have to  provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one  or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is  proof that this is a natural ccurrence, which the Department is required to  protect.   In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than  harass them and call their dam names.  If you want the stream 'restored'to a  dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to  arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter;  they being unable to read English.   In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their  unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water  flows downstream.  They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy  Spring Pond.  If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental  Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources  (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams.).   So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred  for more elevated enforcement action right now.  Why wait until 1/31/2002?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no  way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.   In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real  environmental quality (health) problem in the area.  It is the bears!  Bears  are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be  persecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone.  If you are  going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not  careful where they dump!)   Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you  on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.   Very truly yours, Ryan DeVries       "

The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?

Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           ",

This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.

Consider this startling fact: I can make up any damn fiction I want, and as long as I state that it is explicitly a fact, readers will accept it as so (especially if they are already pre-disposed to agree with said fact), even without any type of documentation to back me up.

We need to go, either just me and you, Linds or as a big group with the other people on this blog...if they wanted too.  But no one has said they do...so....yup.  Me 'n' Kyndall had a fight yesterday, and I can't tell if everything is back to normal.  We haven't really gotten a chance to talk about it.  Boy, she really knows how to make people feel terrible though.   And the Travis thing.  Yeh...I don't know what I'm going to do about that.  I will call you when I get home this afternoon, but this evening  I am going to a 'coffee house' at St. Philip's church in Downtown Franklin.  Anyone want to come?  I don't really know any of the details, but I will later.  I think.  Hummm..what  else is new?  I don't think so, at least in my life.  Won't be talking to Travis online this weekend....sigh...so sad...he's at his dad's house, which I should probably find out where it is.  How much you want to bet that he lives like right next door to me every other weekend, and I have no clue about it.  Actually that would be kinda weird...what if he knows and like, watches me?  Ok, now I'm just scaring myself.  Anyway...did you e-mail him?  Has anyone else talked to him? I'm sure he's  being pounded by everyone in the universe now.  Even my friends at school are like 'where does he live?  We want to talk to him.'  It's ok that you had to go last night, your mom sounded really mad.  How was your choir concert? Oh, wait you just said that it went well, never mind.  It's cool that you went out with your dad for dessert.  Did you get ice cream?  or are you saving up for the Godiva Belgian Dark Chocolate and Brownie Batter?   Um, does anyone what to come to the play Saturday at 7:00?  I might go, if anyone else wants to.  Tickets are $8, so I can pick some up, I just need to know how many.  What else is new in your lives?  Oh, if anyone wants to go the the Coffee House thing with me, just say the words.  The only person I will know there will be Carmen and she'll be waiteressing tables.  I don't want to go alone.

Evidence shows that the tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush have been good for the economy and job seekers.  As consumer sentiment gets better, the demand for goods and services grows.  The higher demand for goods and services means that companies work to provide for those demands.  This means investing money into hiring new workers, for one thing.  From the article (emphasis added): The confidence data helped ease worries that the labor market's slow recovery might undermine consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of economic activity in the United States.   Consumers' hearty spending over the past few years, helped by  tax cuts  and low interest rates, has  helped keep the economy from suffering a sharper downturn .   Economists said a variety of factors likely boosted confidence: the holidays passing without any attacks, the rise in stock indexes to nearly two-year highs,  coming tax refunds  and an end to big layoffs.

      "2": "           WHITE HOUSE COVERS TRACKS BY REMOVING INFORMATION  In a high-tech cover-up, the Washington Post this morning reports the White House is actively scrubbing government websites clean of any of its own previous statements that have now proven to be untrue. Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was   www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the   Mis-Lead .         ",

      "4": "       I suppose. I don't take her for much of an overestimater, though. A tad bit of a dreamer, but that wasn't e'er a crime, so far as in my book.  Hmm. Well, what's been going on lately. I'm in a really EMO mood, so I should probably make a long post and tell you all to ignore it (but that actually means, read it thuroughly and tell other people that I'm depressed, too). Actually no, take it as you will; it's sort of like writing lyrics in the BLog, it doesn't change anything, but it gives a certain sense of...something. I really can't remember since I haven't posted any in quite a while. I might put down one of my newer works for the public perusal...it hasn't been recorded yet, but it'll pretty much tell you where I'm coming from.  Hm, well. So yesterday I sat on the phone with my dad talking about how apathetic I've become to everything, how nothing really seems to be doing it anymore. I started out the whole call by saying, 'I wasn't asleep, just being dysthymic,' and I guess that's how it all got started. I've been feeling it creeping up for the last couple of weeks...it's a scary feeling, kind of, but at the same time, it's really familiar and comforting. It's a honest paradox, but that's the only way I can explain it. I really want to get out of whatever this is, but I cannot.  It's horrible because...well, you all know me. I'm the type of person that says, 'If you aren't willing to help yourself, then I won't help you.' And here, all of the sudden, I try to help myself, and nothing seems to work. I keep asking myself why, and none of it makes any sense. I try to cover it up by doing a thousand things, but I really don't care. It's to the point of knowing and believing I have a lot of great friends to help me, but just not caring. It's like I'd rather be down here where I am, where everything around me is going to die or leave sooner or later.   Again, it's been going on for the better part of two weeks, probably before that, but I'm not super-crazy into looking back that far. I just haven't felt the same about things, nothing really gets me up, it's just flat, or it's sinking. I mean, how sad is this: I'm listening to  Glass In The Trees  by Dead Poetic the other day, and I couldn't help but just stopping the car and scream-crying at myself for about five minutes...god, this feeling.   I know a lot of things I can do to help it, I just can't right now. I really need some time off, first of all; second, I need to talk to Abby about a lot of things, third, I need to talk to my mother, fourth, myself...eh. Sometimes I wonder if any of this is going to help. Actually, all the time I wonder if anything is going to work. As I type this post I don't feel that familiar twinge of fear like I used to with Leigh Anne, I just feel flat...really flat, like a cardboard box with an elephant on it flat.   I guess this is better than being upset about everything...like last night, lordy. I felt like I was never going to get out of that, and like I would never pass out and just kill the pain for a while, until I could readjust the chemicals and wake up the next morning.   Man, that sentence I wrote in English today, I thought about it, after giving myself the guilt trip for making a stupid sentence (how predictable), and said, 'man, this is what I sound like all the time now.' Even my happiness is sad stuff. And the hardest thing is explaining it to anyone, because I'm really afraid of what might happen if I do. I think my dad took it alright, he's a really good guy, and he's pretty much been through it all, he doesn't think anything is weird or crazy anymore. But yeah...explaining this is a nightmare. It's like, first, let's tell the story of how it began, and then the story of how it really kicked in, and all the residual aftershocks from last year, and the obsessive thoughts, and the things I do to try and calm myself, and all the guilty thoughts and the guilt in general. First of all, does anyone really want to listen to this, and second of all, why? Not even I do. Then again, if I wasn't hearing any of it, I probably wouldn't be sitting here typing this. Sigh.  I think I think too much, that's what's causing all this. I just don't know. I really just want to sleep a long time and not face anything, just have it face me. Aie, this is suffocating.  It's nice to let it out though, it's something I rarely do anymore, I sort of save til the appropriate blow moment....it's sort of a bad idea. Hm. Well.  I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed now. It's been a long time since I made a good semi-EMO post, and that was a pretty good one. Yeah.    "

Two, as an actor currently studying acting, I was fascinated by the performances and their varying techniques/approaches to their characters/styles, etc.  Their work was all so intimate that I almost felt voyueristic watching it at times, especially Bill Murray.

I belong to an ENFJ email group, and the following message was sent out recently:  I am in between jobs and wanted to know what other people do for a living.  I am also very interested in whether you consider this to be your passion or a career or a just a job.  Thanks.  As I began to read the replies, I thought that it would be useful to post them here.  Here's one:  The basic tread of ENFJs is a quest to teach. Even though I don't teach professionally now, I am always learning stuff so I can teach. I did teach classical piano for 15 years but grew to hate it because while I did have good and exceptional students from time to time, most were just being enriched by their wealthy parents.   Below is a list of my life's work experience. Please do not think of me as a jack of all trades and master of none because that is not true. I just get bored after awhile and want something new. I have been blessed with the ability to change professions, for example, after fifteen years in the auto business becoming the top salesman for Ford in New Jersey, New York and PA, I started taking lessons on the piano and went on to a full time career in music.  1.  Movie Usher. 2.  Construction worker. ( Under my father ) 3.  Heavy machinery driver. ( Florida Turnpike ) 4.  Radar Operator US Army. 5.  Radio Operator US Army. 6.  Supply Seargent US Army. 7.  Auto Salesman. 8.  Auto Parts Department Manager. 9.  Auto Service Department Manager. 10.  Auto Sales Manager. 11.  Piano Teacher. 12.  Piano Tuner. 13.  Pianist. 14.  Accountant. 15.  Real Estate Salesman. 16.  Insurance Salesman. 17.  Computer programmer. 18.  Investigator for State Police. 19.  Stock and Bond Investor  Interesting.  Here's another reply:  I'm so drawn to teaching that after only three years of being a High School teacher I've put my hand up for having a prac teacher from the local uni. So now I teach the kids and help a new teacher learn how to teach.  It's quite an addiction!  High School teaching is a passion, but not necessarily a career. Like [a previous person mentioned] I see myself getting itchy in a few years. I've always fancied going off to Bible College and becoming the pastor of a church. But I'm scared my heart will be too much in it, which would be very dangerous if things went poorly.  Yet another ENFJ replies:  My first thought on this subject was 'career choice?'  I don't feel that I was able to make a career choice.  I kind of fell into my line of work.  I did extremely well in Office Education in high school (but I probably would have done well in other subjects--it was a VERY small school and there were very few programs available outside of the regular curriculum), and when I needed to make money after I graduated I secured an administrative assistant position at the refinery which was our small town's primary employer.  I worked while I went to the local junior college.  Soon I was married and we moved to a slightly larger town so my husband could attend a university.  Of course, the dutiful wife (I score spades in dutiful), the primary income generation fell to me.  An agency got me an interview with a large bank and after working in various departments I was promoted to receptionist in the trust department, where the Sr. VP and trust officer happened to also be an attorney.  My husband, the gypsy, moved us all over and it seemed that one thing led to another, always working for attorneys, because the work was the highest paying clerical work.  (Meanwhile every attempt of mine to go to college was thwarted by said husband...now my ex!)  And I *was* a very good secretary, anticipating the needs of my bosses (and attorneys are VERY needy), well organized, proficient.  But I was a secretary.  I found it extremely demeaning, because I knew I was capable of so much more.  Now, I find myself LOVING my job at a lawfirm--because I am allowed to be SO MUCH MORE!  I am still a legal secretary, but also a legal technologist, handling the technical needs of the firm.  My goal is for the job to work into full time technology, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that it is just a matter of time.  And believe it or not, I like have the secretarial work when I am experiencing information overload and I need to process or just to do something at which I excel.  I have always been appreciated in my jobs, but I have never felt fulfilled until now.    I have been a 'job hopper' because I 'still hadn't found what I was looking for' to coin a U2 lyric!  I, and I suspect others of my type (ENFJ), needed variety and to feel that I added unique value.  Now I get to do many different things, have lots to learn, many challenges, and I have found the right environment (jeans, relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers).  I notice that I am learning not to take things personally, that I no longer expect to win every battle and indeed that some things are not battles anyway.  For instance, I asked for business cards, but the firm does not provide business cards to anyone but attorneys and paralegals.  I will just print my own and eventually I'm sure I will get firm cards, I realize they have never had anyone in this position and are not ready to set this precedent.  I think all of the personal growths I am recognizing are really just due to wisdom, which has come with my advancing years.  I don't make top dollar, but thanks to my husband I don't have to anymore.    I know this is way more than you wanted to know, but I've waxed eloquent on other occasions about how dissatisfied I was with my occupation, and I just wanted to share what a great change has occurred.  I still feel that it resulted because of circumstances (which I attribute to God) and I'm so grateful!  I don't think it is bad, obviously, to keep changing and hunting and striving for the ideal.  (That said, I didn't get a lot of interviews due to my poor tenure!)      ",

This is being merketed toward my little sister.    Abercrombie & Fitch to your kids: Group sex now!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted: November 14, 2003 1:00 a.m. Eastern    2003 WorldNetDaily.com    Forty-five specific portrayals of sexual imagery in the first 120 pages, advice to the readers ... this is how the new Abercrombie & Fitch Quarterly titled 'The Christmas Field Guide' begins its new quarterly magazine that is targeted to your 10- to 13-year-olds. The 45 images include overt portrayals of group sex, lots of teen and young adult nudity, men kissing, and teens /young adults frolicking in a river engaging in sexual activity in multiple group settings.   Did I mention that the actual clothing doesn't begin being advertised until page 120?   Abercrombie & Fitch are not new to this game and they are taking a huge bet this Christmas season. The wager is ... you won't care enough to do anything about it.   For the last four years a handful of concerned parents and citizens have been waging a miniature war on the popular teen clothier. Each year, the clothier has made hollow gestures at trying to 'reform its act.' But these attempts are not only insincere, they are laughable. Laughable  but they are not funny.   Each year, thousands of children across America beg their parents to get them the latest t-shirt, jeans, jacket or underwear from 'A&F.' (Yes they even market a line of thongs for 8- to 10-year-old girls made to stick up out of the 'low cut' jeans they also sell.) Many of these parents, completely unaware of how 'A&F' goes about marketing, plunk down thousands of dollars around the holidays ... and Abercrombie & Fitch continues to profit.   This year will be different. Thousands of consumers are being put on alert as to the marketing methods of the clothier, web-log writers are going to be commenting on it, church and para-church groups are organizing protests, and this year we will even advise investors via direct links to popular business Internet sites like CBS Marketwatch as to the marketing methods the company is willing to use.   After all, they do say, 'We don't just sell clothes, we promote a lifestyle!' And what kind of 'lifestyle'?   Well, in this year's issue in the 'sexpertise' column on page 279, a lady presumably qualified to be referred to as a 'sexpert' states that kids going to college this year, 'shouldn't be looking for someone to marry.' Nope, when it comes to sex, kids should be 'focused on getting experience.' The 'sexpert' is also asked about and gives advice concerning the issue of doing 'sex for three.' She also advises readers to be willing to 'go down' on a date at the movies, 'just so long as you do not disturb those around you.' And, of course, what kind of column would a 'sexpertise' column be if it did not address the issue of self-stimulation.   There is also a comparison column for the hormonally driven young men in the 'A&F' readership comparing the 'fruits' of biting into 'fresh apple right off the tree' vs. the 'store-bought variety that sit on the shelf wrinkled and bruised from the handling.' This column is not comparing fruit at all but the benefits of teenage men sleeping with perky school girls vs. 'sexy' older women, even married ones.   So the plan of action?   This year's is multi-fold:     Read this column and forward it to everyone you know.   Dial the National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families (toll free) 888-877-7723.   Add your voice to the growing list of parents, teens and citizens who wish to see sexually transmitted disease rates reduced, and less teen pregnancy by signing the letter of protest at Stop A&F.   And by all means spend no money with Abercrombie & Fitch this year. (American Eagle, H&M and a variety of other clothiers provide clothing that is equally fashionable to the style of Abercrombie & Fitch  but without the unnecessary nudity and sexualization of Americans aged 10 to 18.)   In a day in which more parents than ever are concerned about the likelihood of their daughter getting pregnant, their child being sexually active long before they are mature enough to handle the consequences or the rampant spread of sexually transmitted diseases in the 'younger than 20' demographic today  it's time to stop Abercrombie & Fitch.   Abercrombie & Fitch is wagering you won't care about what they do, so they've rolled the dice. For me, my money is on the decency of you and the hope you have for the future of your kids.   So ... I'll take that bet!        "

Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses.

According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article   here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.

It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.

It was a pretty crazy idea, but I came up with it in the shower this morning (as I do with all crazy ideas). To write the history of man through the eyes of God. Of course, God is a cynic and thinks all human ideas and religions have completely lost it. He toys with his power, he explains the concept of creation and reason for the world's greatest disasters: the Flood, the Black Plague, the Holocaust, and so on, he explains his own creation and the creation of the universe in the best way he knows how...which is, of course, not at all.   It won't be very long. Mostly, it will show coincidences between the plane of God and the mortal realm, and why God think about things the way he does. You might be thinking, 'This is probably some staidly religious story, isn't it?' Let me assure you, if God isn't the way he is in this story, and more in the biblical vein of God, I'm going to fry forever. But it's a great idea, I think. Who'd have ever though of the story of the world from the vantage point of the one who made it...slightly twisting commonly accepted ideals about God, however that may be.  This might take a little longer than I thought, though. It's sort of hard to make God sound assured of his power without being overly cocky. I just need to make him sound like he  knows  he is badass, because he is.   And trust in this, it's hard to do it without lapsing into a few lines of God's laughing uproariously at humanity, because it sounds like he's on the verge of it in this story most of the time.    "

It's hard to explain where they're all coming from. You think you have a feeling beat, but it decides to reincarnate and spring up on you. If I hear one more thing about Jennifer I'm going to kill myself.  School's ok. I passed US History, I can't complain. Barely, mind. But I frick'n did. The test damn near gave me a seizure at first sight, but it was alright, as well.  I had fun last night on a treadmill, and about made my heart explode. I even fell off at one point, I don't think anyone saw tho, except my mom who was right next to me. And I was simultaneously watching something really smutty on VH1, but I couldn't hear it since my headphones weren't working. It appeared very smutty.  But I kicked the crap out of a punching bag while I was there. And had fun with a medicine ball. My mother made me sterile with said ball, which wasn't too thrilling...she overthrew just a bit. At least I made a funny deflating noise as I was unusually castrated.  Altho today I was reminded of the little plastic baby I had to take home in 8th grade. You know...the ones that cry and you put the keys in their backs, et cetera...and I was forced to wonder if maybe it was a gift that I was rendered incapable of reproduction. But no. It didn't happen, nor do I hate children or not want a family someday.  My hair is annoying. I've been thinking about getting it cut a lot lately, but knowing that I won't. I just wish the bangs would grow a bit more so that 1. I wouldn't have to trim it to mullet length for a while so as to get bangs, and 2. so that I could have a ponytail, so that conversations and consuming wouldn't consisting of me spitting out hair every three seconds.  Yesterday was the 25 year anniversary of Pope John Paul II. THE POPE!!! In Stout's class today, someone wrote, 'The Pope is Dope!' on the board, and Julian stapled a sign on her message board that reads, 'Got Pope?' I have one of those signs, it's going in my room somewhere. I feel bad for John Paul...he's probably the last of the fully pious left, and he's about to buy the farm.   To the best of us...  I've been trapped in my room lately. Mom's on the phone all the time (a serious hinderance to Abby Time, by the way), and Kate's always on the computer until really late, so I never get to use it anymore. Not til the weekends, like right now.  So that pretty much means I sit in my room and think my insane thoughts and go crazy. Man, the last couple 'o weeks have been frickin' distorted. Seriously. I even scared myself with the writings that have come out of me lately.  Like, my mom actually came out and confronted me with being anorexic...that was some shit. I was going, 'No...' But it would be just like me tho, wouldn't it? This is my struggle-free year, but this year I get to set myself up for the fall next year, plummeting into the depths of anorexia and madness. Yeh, let's hope not. A lot. I'm really not too keen on dying at the moment.  O well. I think I had more, but I thought about it too much, and have thusly forgotten it. I've been thinking of doing a gargantuan post all day, but this is the best I could do. Too tired. Too many dreams and 'old man moments', where I wake up way early for no reason, and stare at the ceiling and think of random stuff til the alarm goes off.  O well again. Irrelevently yours.

      "2": "              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

      "3": "           Following are excerpts from Justice Kennedy's majority opinion in Lawrence vs. Texas, handed down June 26.  Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions ...  It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family. For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives. These considerations do not answer the question before us, however. The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law. 'Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.' [Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, (1992)] ...  The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed.           ",

      "4": "       I need to make this post.  I need to tell you all something very important, and you can do with it what you will.  There's someone very familiar that you all need to meet. I'll come back to that.  This thing with Calhoun did not start this, it only confirmed it.   Today, I had a really bad day. It wasn't the saddening kind that makes me think suicide. Quite the contrary. This was a day that is going to change my life, it was so bad. I was not depressed. I realized that I was fucking horribly mad. More than mad, I was homocidal. I joke about it a lot, but mark me, MARK ME, I was thinking about taking a baseball bat over to that stupid whore's house and finishing the job her ex didn't. And mark me on that one, too. This is all going to come to a point, I promise, but there's going to be a ton of malice beforehand. I said do with it what you will, and I hope that you'll do just that.  Actually, I didn't get homocidal until about a hour ago. Beforehand I was complacent, I was stoic. I sat back and got pissed but I didn't blow up. I always do that. Like I told Abby earlier tonight, I was just 'on a low simmer'. But for some reason this one just wouldn't stay there. I blew up a couple of minutes ago. I started banging things, and Katie was laughing and so was I. I didn't think I was serious when I was saying, GOD I'M SO FUCKING MAD. But then I felt great. Why?  I felt great because I accept the reality of my situation. I've been repressing it. I don't know why. I came down to earth and said what the mother fuck I really felt about it, and I embraced the godawful truth of it. It's that I am so fucking sick of being complacent and respectful to these dickheads that are going to fuck around with me, like that stupid whore, and like Julian, and this other kid I just heard about, pulling some shit.  I figured something else out. I figured out how much complacency I have with the cycle of abuses. You know how people do? First, things are going ok, you think it's all alright and whatnot, and you trust the person. Then they start to slip and pull some shit. And then...then they just come out and abuse openly, and they don't care what the fuck you have to say about it. And THEN, and here's the good part, they try to make up for it, and mostly, THOSE FUCKING CUNTS GET THE FUCK AWAY WITH IT!!!! ALWAYS!!!! And why is that? Because we all remember how good it used to be, and we figure they'll change, so we give them another chance, and another and another, and we convince ourselves that they actually are good people and that their bad, abusive sides really aren't what they are.   I'VE GIVEN IN TO THEM!!! WE ALL HAVE!!! I ALWAYS give in to Calhoun! I ALWAYS give in to shit, because I'm in love with the ideal, rather than reality!! I fucking hate reality! I don't live here! And therein lies the problem.  I've given up trying to exist in this world. I let the complacent side get the better of me. And I know I have, and so I have some apologies to give out later. But I gave up, and I let this dumbass motherfucker take over, this thing that I'm not. This thing that doesn't think for himself, he thinks for everyone else. He doles out advice but he can't ever adhere to any. I just gave up a long time ago, but suddenly, I'm back. Thanks, Calhoun.  And so, I need you all to meet this person I gave up on because he was too perverted, too coarse, too vulgar. He was the thing I talked about in that song,  I'm Just A Bastard .  He's me.  I've tried so long to keep him back, and I don't know why. Maybe I thought that everyone couldn't accept him, but now I know...everyone just has to, or they just have to leave me be.   So now: I need to tell the ones that have to hear this how incredibly sorry I am that I've been the one pulling the shit and blinding you towards the real me. I'll detail all the circumstances and then you'll know...perhaps you have known. Whatever the case, I need to tell you, the real me does, the one that has occasional and guiltless bad thoughts, and thinks that some shit really is gay, and really wants to take some people out.  And I want you all to know right here and now: I am not blaming ANY of you for ANY of this. I don't want to hear an 'I'm sorry' over any of this, this is TOTALLY not any of your faults. This is something I have done to myself, entirely. It could be said that your actions influenced it...don't think that either. It's how I stupidly interpreted them. If there's one thing I can't stress enough, it's to keep being yourselves. I'm preaching it, yes, and right now I'm going to adhere to it.   Please, don't take any of this the wrong way. I've felt it growing like a tangible presence since...god knows when. But it's been there since I can remember, and I finally figured out what it was, and am in the process of dealing with it.  Linds was right when she said, 'the longer you wait the harder it will be', but I mean more than just with Calhoun. I've been waiting so damned long and not admitting to myself that I have a pretty fucking bad problem that it's turned into a nearly-impossible-to-resolve crisis. But I'm going to handle this. I hope I don't scare any of you away.  I just can't keep him in anymore. All I ask is that you allow me to let him come out.  So tomorrow...'fuck her feelings'. In case I get suspended or do something really stupid and not like me, you all will know why because...I'm telling you. If she's going to get righteous with me, then fuck-a-hootenanny, I'm going to get righteous and then fucking some. I won't get fucking pissed on again, ever. Mark that shit, too.  No more abuses. 'I wonder when all the abuses became commonplace.' It just boggles me how hard I was trying NOT to think about them.  I'm sorry for this post, and I'm sorry for what might follow. But I just can't do the way I'm doing, for fear of losing my fucking mind.   Please bear with me as I try to heal all this damage I've caused. I'm so sorry to all of you I've hurt by this, whether you've noticed or not, I don't know what I can do to make it better. Hell, I don't know how to forgive myself yet.  Please forgive me. I'm sorry.      "

There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?'   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, 'Yeah....right....whatever you say man.'  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being 'Hero of the World' is kind of pretentious in his eyes.  ",

But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike.

Our family is in such financial circumstances that we cannot afford an additional phone line or DSL.  I recognized that while I am online at home that potential employers are not able to get through to us.  We're trying to make ourselves more available by letting employers know they can email us, but I have a feeling that we need some other way for them to contact us.  Does anyone know of a free voicemail service?  We may even want to look at how much getting the phone company's voicemail system is.  At least there we could have calls transferred to our voicemail if we were online or busy.  It's funny, but I've asked the above question without doing an Internet search first.

It does not matter if he  already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain.  As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.   Rule #2:  If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word  ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. 'Hey  George, can I borrow your ratchet?' 'OK. By-the-way, are you through  with my 3/8-inch socket yet?' Again, no one knows why.   Rule #3:  If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99-cent  ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his  rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.   Rule #4:  Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes.  Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he  wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.   Rule #5:  You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn  out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the  little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips,  and flips....   Rule #6:  Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in  a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.   Rule #7:  Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or  deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.   Rule #8:  Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple  of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. 'Socks. Shorts.  Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink.' You get the idea. No one knows why.   Rule #9:  Never buy a man anything that says 'some assembly required' on the box.  It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.   Rule #10:  Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, ParrLumber,  Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire.(NAPA Auto  Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It  doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. 'From NAPA Auto, eh? Must  be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane?  Wow! Thanks.')   Rule #11:  Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue.  Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the  gas line leaks. 'Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?'   Rule #12:  Tickets to a Seahawks game are a smart gift. However, he will not  appreciate tickets to 'A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts.' Everyone  knows why.   Rule #13:  Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you  don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a  label maker.   Rule #14:  It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension  ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder. It must be an extension  ladder. No one knows why.   Rule #15:  Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least  the Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8' manila  rope. No one knows why.       "

I've updated my reading list via   AllConsuming.net .  You can check out what I'm currently reading at   Dan's Domain .  There is one book I'm reading that is not in the AllConsuming.net database as of yet.  That book is entitled   Crime in the City , and it is edited by Martin Edwards.  It features short stories with the theme of big-city crime.  This collection was sponsored by the British Crime Writer's Association.   He Loves to Play Guitar!  One of my goals in learning the acoustic guitar is to be able to sing along with it.  Since I first started in December of last year, I have longed to be able to put something together that has some meaning.  Folk songs, children's songs, church songs, even the blues.  That's why I was so encouraged to find the tabulature (that's guitar-speak for the fret-string positions) for a great blues riff.  It's almost as good as having B.B. King here to teach me!   She Ain't Heavy, She's My Daughter!  Last Saturday morning, Keisha, Jake (our dog), and I went to the field near where we live for a walk and some outdoor play time.  I had the idea that Keisha and I could race between two markers.  I went first.  When it came time for Keisha to go, she resisted.  I offered to hold her hand and run with her.  We took off, but Keisha soon decided that it was too much for her.   She tried to let go, but I clung to her coatsleeve, and then she fell to the ground.  Eager to develop the fighter spirit in her (i.e., the resolve not to give up so easily), I bent down to pick her back up.  Immediately, I felt something 'pull' in my lower back, and I knew I'd made a big mistake.  I rounded up Keisha and Jake, and we headed home.  I applied some topical ointment (not Ben-Gay, but something similar) and sat on a heating pad.  Both of these seemed to help.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   It's not really a McJob  I had my first night of training at my new part-time job Saturday night.  I manned the bun warmer.  This task, of course lent itself to several double entendre type remarks: 'Here's your buns!  They're nice and toasty!'  'Hot, steamy buns!  Yours for the picking!'  During my break I caught a few minutes of Forrest Gump, which aired on ABC.  As a result, I broke into my Forrest Gump routine, talking in my best Gump-ish voice.  That seemed to entertain my coworkers.  There was that remark about whether my being around the grill had affected me, though...  Nevertheless, I helped the crew to close the place, and I made the 20-minute jaunt home.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Sleepin' In On A Sunday Mornin'   Jennie and I forgot to set our alarm clock, so we wound up waking up when it was too late to get to church.  I guess it happens from time to time to everyone.  I really wasn't in any condition to go anywhere, though.  My back was feeling the pain in a major way.  I wound up calling in sick to work, letting the shift manager know that I'd be going to the doctor on Monday.  Which reminds me...   Papa called the Doctor, and the Doctor Said...   Jennie needed Mom's car on Monday, so I planned to catch the bus to my doctor's appointment.  I headed downtown and bought a monthly bus pass.  Then I grabbed several bus schedules and headed toward the bus stop.  I had never been on that particular bus before, so I was naturally confused when the driver took us way past where the doctor's office was.  After conferring with the driver, I realized that I could have gotten off a half an hour earlier and walked the rest of the way to the doctor's office.  Since he was heading back in that direction, that's exactly what I did.  I arrived about 45 minutes early for my appointment, and there I stayed, caught between a rock and a hard place -- deciding whether to let the Musak put me to sleep or to continue reading the book I brought with me.  The latter won out, albeit not without a fight.  Soon the nurse grabbed me, and I weighed in at a hefty 217 pounds.  She led me to the examining room.  Not too long a young gentleman, a student doctor, appeared.  He mentioned that he'd be helping my doctor today.  I told the chap what was wrong, and he was able to manipulate the upper part of my back.  I felt a little bit of relief.  After he left, my doctor entered.  He twisted me up like a pretzel (well, not quite) and was able to get the rest of my back realigned.  I'm still taking the pain medicine (8-hour Tylenol) for a little while, but the prognosis is good:  No more picking up Keisha without proper back posture!  Yeah, I'm feeling better.  Which reminds me that I need to tell you about...   Doctor EverythingWillBeAlright   Okay, so I'm being a bit sarcastic or otherwise loopy in this post.  I went to see the psychiatrist today.  Apparently there was an incident between a patient and him this morning that involved the police, so all subsequent appointments were delayed.  I decided to wait in the unbearable heat caused by the faulty HVAC system.  I was afraid that the female workers were going to comment about my chest and bellybutton hair, though! (just kidding)  The wait was about 45 minutes, and I used the time to catch up with my planner.  It was almost like meeting an old friend; I hadn't really used it since last Friday.  I eventually saw the doctor, and we talked about stuff that patients and psychiatrists talk about.  He was interested in whether the scab-picking had subsided; I told him that it hadn't.  The scabs are just hidden by my long-sleeve shirt, jeans, and baseball cap.  I also mentioned some depression episodes I'd had over the last few months.  There were some really intense times, as I may have mentioned here, that I'd just wanted to die.  The doc calls them 'passive' rather than active feelings of suicide - i.e., not real, concrete plans to do away with myself.  We talked about how the past few years has been for me, how I felt I'd changed over that time.  It was really uplifting for me to see how much I have grown, how my perspective on life has changed.  I think I'm gonna be alright.  And speaking of things that are going to be alright...   Bookish voters approve library levy   That's the headline from today's   Dayton Daily News .  As a regular to the county's library system, I am quite grateful that others in the community share my desire to keep the library great.  I'd even love to have a part-time job at the library.  We'll have to see if they end the hiring freeze anytime soon.  Which reminds me of this other money-related story...   Dayton market sells $20M Mega Millions ticket   The Dayton Daily News also reports: 'Ohio Lottery officials said Wednesday that someone bought a winning ticket for Tuesday's Mega Millions $20 million jackpot at the Food City store at 1829 Germantown St.'  Maybe this person is or will soon be one of my (new) friends...

Effectively working with others really is an art. Being in the limelight appeals to almost everyone, but cooperation, not competition, is at the heart of win-win relationships. Win-win means agreements or solutions benefit and satisfy all parties-not your way or my way, but a better way. See if these tips can help you get a better angle on win-win:   Solid Performance.   When the camera's not rolling, does your walk and talk reflect what matters most to you? If you know what is a win for you, others will as well. Integrity of character establishes trust.  Balance.   A win-win requires maturity-a balance between courage and consideration. You express your feelings and ideas with courage, but also share the stage and allow others to do the same.  Plenty for All.   With win-wins, you develop an Abundance Mentality and realize that everyone can have a piece of the pie. Sharing prestige and recognition opens the doors for greater options, alternatives, and creativity. Mutually beneficial solutions -- what could be more rewarding?    ",

This is about Leigh Anne, and perhaps I put it off because she didn't like it but it's time to reminisce. I've been thinking about this post all morning, the little nuances I was going to put in it.  My cousin Seth described his last relationship with his girlfriend Brooke, and in many ways it was like mine, in many ways it has ended in the same way. 'Do you love me?', and he would cynically reply at the end, 'More and more everyday...' and then look up at me as he hung up, roll his eyes, and try to suffocate himself with his own pillow. Somehow, I was the same at the end, perhaps not with the same words, but in the way I started to feel as she broke more towards my friends than me, as Brooke did.  This morning I was putting off waking up, staring at that same cloud strewn sky as the past three days, and suddenly I was intensely bemused, as I was thinking about our amazing but brief relationship that ended in such disaster, and all because of me, this time. But I laughed...laughed for all the good times, for horses that resembled amoeba, for random thoughts, for finding pieces of ourselves in each other that we had never thought we would see, to be more amazed by each other every day, and for all of that to end, for all the dreams and promises to die nearly overnight. I laughed because, after all, I'm just a litte human in the end, and losing this girl, as completely apart from the rest of the world as she is, these losses, this breaking of spirits happens all the time, and as it was caused by me this time, why have I to complain?   But I still remember them all fondly...perhaps a little too fondly, as they creep between my thought and make themselves apparent every once in a while in some process of life. Like doing geometry, for some reason that incubates these thoughts, or for sitting alone, which I have a lot of time to do these days, it helps these thought to permeate the shallower reaches of my ever-going mind.  It feels like it's not over, and I guess in some ways it still isn't, it takes time for everyone to get over these things. The only problem with me, is, I don't think that my thoughts are going to let me go on this one, for a long time. I really don't know what to do but to just let things happen, and if it really does end in us apart, then so long to yesterday.  And strangely, these bittersweet memories permeate again.  Oh, how I miss her already.    "

      "0": "        What Career Choices Do ENFJs Make?   ENFJ is one of the sixteen Myers-Briggs Types.  I'm an ENFJ.  For more information on what this means specifically, you can check out this   web page .  You could also search it in your favorite search engine; there's a Google search utility on this blog, as a matter of fact.  I belong to an ENFJ email group, and the following message was sent out recently:  I am in between jobs and wanted to know what other people do for a living.  I am also very interested in whether you consider this to be your passion or a career or a just a job.  Thanks.  As I began to read the replies, I thought that it would be useful to post them here.  Here's one:  The basic tread of ENFJs is a quest to teach. Even though I don't teach professionally now, I am always learning stuff so I can teach. I did teach classical piano for 15 years but grew to hate it because while I did have good and exceptional students from time to time, most were just being enriched by their wealthy parents.   Below is a list of my life's work experience. Please do not think of me as a jack of all trades and master of none because that is not true. I just get bored after awhile and want something new. I have been blessed with the ability to change professions, for example, after fifteen years in the auto business becoming the top salesman for Ford in New Jersey, New York and PA, I started taking lessons on the piano and went on to a full time career in music.  1.  Movie Usher. 2.  Construction worker. ( Under my father ) 3.  Heavy machinery driver. ( Florida Turnpike ) 4.  Radar Operator US Army. 5.  Radio Operator US Army. 6.  Supply Seargent US Army. 7.  Auto Salesman. 8.  Auto Parts Department Manager. 9.  Auto Service Department Manager. 10.  Auto Sales Manager. 11.  Piano Teacher. 12.  Piano Tuner. 13.  Pianist. 14.  Accountant. 15.  Real Estate Salesman. 16.  Insurance Salesman. 17.  Computer programmer. 18.  Investigator for State Police. 19.  Stock and Bond Investor  Interesting.  Here's another reply:  I'm so drawn to teaching that after only three years of being a High School teacher I've put my hand up for having a prac teacher from the local uni. So now I teach the kids and help a new teacher learn how to teach.  It's quite an addiction!  High School teaching is a passion, but not necessarily a career. Like [a previous person mentioned] I see myself getting itchy in a few years. I've always fancied going off to Bible College and becoming the pastor of a church. But I'm scared my heart will be too much in it, which would be very dangerous if things went poorly.  Yet another ENFJ replies:  My first thought on this subject was 'career choice?'  I don't feel that I was able to make a career choice.  I kind of fell into my line of work.  I did extremely well in Office Education in high school (but I probably would have done well in other subjects--it was a VERY small school and there were very few programs available outside of the regular curriculum), and when I needed to make money after I graduated I secured an administrative assistant position at the refinery which was our small town's primary employer.  I worked while I went to the local junior college.  Soon I was married and we moved to a slightly larger town so my husband could attend a university.  Of course, the dutiful wife (I score spades in dutiful), the primary income generation fell to me.  An agency got me an interview with a large bank and after working in various departments I was promoted to receptionist in the trust department, where the Sr. VP and trust officer happened to also be an attorney.  My husband, the gypsy, moved us all over and it seemed that one thing led to another, always working for attorneys, because the work was the highest paying clerical work.  (Meanwhile every attempt of mine to go to college was thwarted by said husband...now my ex!)  And I *was* a very good secretary, anticipating the needs of my bosses (and attorneys are VERY needy), well organized, proficient.  But I was a secretary.  I found it extremely demeaning, because I knew I was capable of so much more.  Now, I find myself LOVING my job at a lawfirm--because I am allowed to be SO MUCH MORE!  I am still a legal secretary, but also a legal technologist, handling the technical needs of the firm.  My goal is for the job to work into full time technology, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that it is just a matter of time.  And believe it or not, I like have the secretarial work when I am experiencing information overload and I need to process or just to do something at which I excel.  I have always been appreciated in my jobs, but I have never felt fulfilled until now.    I have been a 'job hopper' because I 'still hadn't found what I was looking for' to coin a U2 lyric!  I, and I suspect others of my type (ENFJ), needed variety and to feel that I added unique value.  Now I get to do many different things, have lots to learn, many challenges, and I have found the right environment (jeans, relaxed atmosphere, great coworkers).  I notice that I am learning not to take things personally, that I no longer expect to win every battle and indeed that some things are not battles anyway.  For instance, I asked for business cards, but the firm does not provide business cards to anyone but attorneys and paralegals.  I will just print my own and eventually I'm sure I will get firm cards, I realize they have never had anyone in this position and are not ready to set this precedent.  I think all of the personal growths I am recognizing are really just due to wisdom, which has come with my advancing years.  I don't make top dollar, but thanks to my husband I don't have to anymore.    I know this is way more than you wanted to know, but I've waxed eloquent on other occasions about how dissatisfied I was with my occupation, and I just wanted to share what a great change has occurred.  I still feel that it resulted because of circumstances (which I attribute to God) and I'm so grateful!  I don't think it is bad, obviously, to keep changing and hunting and striving for the ideal.  (That said, I didn't get a lot of interviews due to my poor tenure!)      ",

At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",

But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not.

So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.

The only part of next year I'm not happy about is that I actually have to write stupid essays that will get me accepted or rejected from a college along with the academics and then Blair. Not to mention I hope I'll get into my student worship team. *crosses fingers* Just smile. I've kinda learned that a big part of our feelings is up to our mind.

I have a suggestion. Next week is kinda in the air for me but I have a feeling that I'll be doing more college application essays. What if we did the party on Monday, the 16th... like after school? Would that work for everyone? Who would 'everyone' at the party be? Is that going to work for everyone else in here since we're the 'core' group? Opinions?  Will, I know. Linds said the exact same thing. I know you all have reservations with him but again, it's my choice. I have my reasons though they might not make sense to you. The main part is that I realized that I really don't need him to be happy. He just kinda tags along to make me laugh and vice versa. It's something that feels 'right' for both of us.     "

But more mainstream groups, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), are also targeted by ALEC as a 'threat,' and the bill would back that up with severe action.   For activists, the danger lies in how A4884 defines 'terrorist' organizations, as 'any association, organization, entity, coalition, or combination of two or more persons with the primary or incidental purpose of supporting any politically motivated activity through intimidation, coercion, fear, or other means.' Activist groups fear that lawful dissent, such as demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns, and leafleting, might fall into any one of those categories, particularly the catchall phrase 'other means.' The bill also seeks to prohibit people from gathering photographic or videotaped evidence of illegal or harmful activities, effectively shutting down the camcorders and other tools used by 21st-century protesters. Additionally, the bill calls for the creation of a state-run website where people convicted of 'eco-terrorism or animal-rights terrorism' would be identified with photographs and stigmatized, much as states do with child molesters.

America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'     -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          ",

I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).

      "1": "             BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.

In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",

The boys were so good at getting into trouble that their parents knew if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons were probably involved.   The boys' mother heard that a clergyman in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys.   The clergyman agreed, but asked to see them individually.   So the mother sent her 8-year-old in first that morning, with the older boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.   The clergyman, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, 'Where is God?'  The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide eyed.  So the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner tone, 'Where is God!!?'    Again the boy made no attempt to answer.    So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, ' WHERE IS GOD!? '    The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.  When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, 'What happened?'    The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied, 'We are in  BIG  trouble this time, dude. God is missing-and they think  WE  did it.!'          ",

II, 1, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution and failing to comply with 3 U. S. C. 5, and whether the use of standardless manual recounts violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. With respect to the equal protection question, we find a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Florida Supreme Court has ordered that the intent of the voter be discerned from such ballots. For purposes of resolving the equal protection challenge, it is not necessary to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court had the authority under the legislative scheme for resolving election disputes to define what a legal vote is and to mandate a manual recount implementing that definition. The recount mechanisms implemented in response to the decisions of the Florida Supreme Court do not satisfy the minimum requirement for non-arbitrary treatment of voters necessary to secure the fundamental right. Florida's basic command forthe count of legally cast votes is to consider the 'intent of the voter.' Gore v. Harris, ___ So. 2d, at ___ (slip op., at 39). This is unobjectionable as an abstract proposition and a starting principle. The problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to ensure its equal application. The formulation of uniform rules to determine intent based on these recurring circumstances is practicable and, we conclude, necessary.  While I understand Ted Rall's frustration with having Bush as president, I do not agree that the election was a judicial coup d'etat.  What it was though is an example, notedin the supreme court ruling itself, that the vote counting systems in this country are antiquated and need to be changed and standardized so everyone's vote can be counted. Florida was having different counties determine what was and was not a 'hanging chad'.  how can this be considered equal protection for all state voters wheneach district has it's own standards about what constitutes a vote?  and jimi, this case in front of the supreme court was brought by bush not by gore.

If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         ",

It sounds just like the better parts of Metallica, Black Album-era, and even though I can't understand what he's saying, and no, it's not like Rotting Christ garbled, it's  just  like Metallica, and I mean down to the vocals, the lyrics are simply catchy. It's enough by this one song to make me by the album. And believe me, considering how much I like Rotting Christ, I was  ultimately  unimpressed by the first song of theirs I heard,  A Dead Poem .  As for other news, I'm getting the AudioBLogger in a few days. Here's the plan: those posts are going to be geared toward certain topics, and they're only going to be on the weekend, thrice a weekend, since those are the times I have no Internet, and they all have titles for the next three months, such as the first one,  Hello/The Names , which is the introduction to the audbloggings and discussing some of the names in here, and yes, I already have all of these written out. The whole catch is, only two minutes to each post. Which means I have to be  quick  in divulging the secrets of life, or harder, my life in general. The second posts is  The Dreams , talking about having a thousand dreams lately, about the most random things.  That shall be about soon.  Until then, keep it bitter, so to speak.    "

'Orville made the world's first sustained, controlled flight in a powered airplane near Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17, 1903.

What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles     Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.             ",

Now that I think about it, I don't really know why I like it...mostly, I just do. It really takes a special appreciation to be able to listen to it and enjoy it. Everyone, on some level of consciousness or another, knows that all it really is is a big wall of sound, some guy screaming until his vocal cords collapse, blaring guitars founded on the same three or four power chords (differently arranged for each song, of course, we need to look like musicians), drums...well...they're insanely fast, some bands, like Nile, you can't really tell they're actually keeping time, it sounds like he's just nailing the fuck out of the closest skin he can get to.   But still, I guess it preaches to those wonderful unconscious aggressions we try so hard to keep to ourselves. Perhaps our enjoying it is a facet of our expressing said aggressions in a passive way. Mostly all the real dmetal listeners I know are pretty placid with the world, since they purge the aggression each time they press the play button.

I got my job through a website called   www.jobs.net .   I was doing my daily job search at my local workforce one in Florida, and I stumbled across this website, which I'd never heard of before. I decided to check this site out, and I found a position called yacht finance specialist (a.k.a administrative assistant). The funny thing about this position was it posted on August 18, 2003, and it was still on their site on November 12, 2003. I called the employer, and the reason why they did not find anyone was because none of the other candidates had passed the credit check. The company is owned by a bank, and passing a credit check is required.  In the post to which Sue responded, we posed some specific questions.  Below we've listed the questions along with her answers.   What position were you applying for?  Administrative Assistant  How did you contact the particular company?  I called the company and then faxed them my resume  Describe the interviewing process.  It was pretty simple.  They were only interested in me because they had already posted this position on   careerbuilder.com  and had not yet found anyone qualified for it.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  No  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  I interviewed for the position on November 18th.  I returned on December 1st and was hired after I found out I passed the credit check.  Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.  I kept wondering why the credit check was taking so long.      ",

What he really meant was that Jennie was going to start pushing.  I don't remember if he increased the Pitocin dose or not -- come to think of it, he may have reduced it -- I can't remember for sure.  So, as a contraction started Jennie began to push.  And push she did.  I had never seen anyone go through labor before, but I'd heard that women show so much strength that it behooves a man to appreciate and respect her so much more.  Cindy was taping the labor, which we later determined to be about 21 minutes long.  I can hardly imagine going through 21 minutes of pushing, but Jennie did.  I recall Sue asking Cindy, toward the end of that 21 minutes, 'Is that hair I see?'  which I took to mean that Keisha was close.  After about 17 minutes, the doctor became concerned.  Every contraction was beginning to affect Keisha's heartbeat.  We weren't getting anywhere with the natural birthing, so he ordered a Caesarean section.  An anesthesiologist came in to administer a 'spinal' to Jennie, but she couldn't find the place in Jennie's back to inject the anesthesia.  So the doctor ordered a 'general' anesthetic, which would put Jennie to sleep.  Jennie was taken to an Operating Room, where they would perform the Caesarean.  Because she was under a general anesthetic, I wasn't allowed in the room.  I felt very saddened by it.  Cindy, who manned the camera, asked me to comment on camera what was going on.  I explained it to an older Keisha, who would later be watching this video.  Then I heard something that made me break into tears.  I heard our baby crying behind me.  Keisha was born at 10:42 PM, July 17, 1997!  The nurse came out to get a port-a-crib thingy, which they would use to transport Keisha to the Transitional Nursery.  She said that I could come in to see her.  So Cindy handed me the camera.  Just minutes from being outside the womb, there she was: all wrapped up in cloths, crying.  I was in awe.  God's creation, which we'd waited for nine months, was here!  I followed the nurse to the Transitional Nursery, where I met Ms. Yvetta, the Transitional Nurse.  She checked all of Keisha's vitals, and I was able to tape the whole event.  It would be important, I knew, for Jennie and an older Keisha to see all of this.  Yvetta gave Keisha her first bath, and Keisha cried when she got her hair washed.  She still doesn't like getting it washed.  Then it was time for me to clean her umbilical cord.  I was so nervous; I didn't want to hurt my baby or anything like that.  Yvetta reassured me that everything was okay.  Then I got to put her very first diaper on her.  It was a little thing!  But then again, so was my baby!  Sort of.  She weighed in at 7 pounds, 2-1/2 ounces, and 21 inches long.  After the Transitional Nursery, we took Keisha to go meet her Mommy, who was waking up in the Recovery Room.  It was a beautiful event.  I can remember holding our baby in my arms, just like it was yesterday.  Having a baby changes your life forever.         ",

I mean think about it.....the whole world believes that everyone has there place and if they leave it......here comes the tidal waves. Crossing social barriers in BHS is next to impossible without whispers and stares. Is this what they call America, the most welcome country? Everyone plays to the role untill that role is all they have, so they stick to that role through life then pass it to there children. Ugg why can't people be themselves. Why can't people NOT fit the mold for once?'  'Slowly all the roles we act out become our identity, and in the end we are what we pretend to be' said Jerry once. It's like being a pack of animals, people will find a common ground and build on it, and that's how we get our social classes. Unless someone is truly  above  all of this shit, and it would be sort of nice to be that way, but it's unlikely. Social distinction, just another one of those shit consequences of having to be alive in the New Age.  And an Elizabethan reply (from Z, of course) for this post for anyone interested, on the 31: thereafter I posted all the lyrics to Poor Bastard, etc., more whining, then some more whining, DI, and on and on....oh yeah, the reply:  'Hey, Rosie, just a question. Why do you care? I for one am perfectly happy in my lack of social standing. I have thought of this subject before, however, and have decided that I don't care. And since when do I fit the mold? I'm one example. There have to be others. Linds, maybe.'  .Dne eht    "

For the sake of this argument, let's say that Trent Lott DIRECTLY said he was in favor of segregation and all the other race garbage from the South of 50 years ago.

If the Republicans want him as their leader, that is their choice.  Keep in mind that, according to a black radio show host I saw on TV the other day (Tom Joyner?), 98% of the black vote in this country goes to the Democrats.  Odds are, the voters who would vote based on only the issue of Civil Rights, already voted for the Democrats because of the perception (wrong in my opinion) that the Democrats are more dedicated to that issue.  So, what damage is there to be done by taking the black vote away?  Politically, none.         ",

C-3PO has switched heads with another robot!  hilarious, huh?'  by that point, i'm cringing, hoping it will stop, and that we'll get on with that 'other' plot thread of watching the jedi council beng attacked by the forces of Darth Tyrannus.  we can't say we weren't warned, though, even before episode one; namely, with the ewoks, in episode six... but even that was tolerable, given that things were on the upswing - it's (sort of) a pleasant thing to see the furry warriors triumph over the evil empire.  by that point, we feel the immense scale of the overall conflict - a galactic conflict between good and evil, spanning hundreds of worlds, coming together in a final battle.  the ewoks aren't distracting in e6 because they seem like a small part of a much larger tapestry.    in e1 and e2, however, the sight gags and the bad puns seem to be given the same weight as the rest of the events in the story.  the ewoks were just a little something for the kids in e6, and a way to symbolize the hope of a happier future for the galaxy; they're not important to the great arc of things, and the screen time that they are given is balanced with the bigger events accordingly.  heck, a couple of the ewoks are even shown dying in the battle; but lucas wouldn't have dared showing any gungans getting creamed - he's too afraid of scaring the kids now.  he was a little bolder in e2, with the assination attempt at the beginning, but it's easy to kill off characters that we met, oh, 2 seconds before they blew up.   ok, 8 seconds if you count the screen time padme's stand-in had in e1 - but you see my point.    when qui-gon dies at the end of e1, it's unfortunate.  when obi-wan 'dies' at the end of e4, it's a tragedy.  why?  probably something to do with acting, character development, etc.  but more than that - in e4, obi-wan and the rest of the gang never had to compete with cartoon characters (and background sets) for screen time.  like you said, JLS - pretty pictures.  a new trilogy for a different crowd; lighter, goofier, and in the end, a kid's movie.  and once i accept this, i find i can enjoy the whole experience with a much less critical, cynical eye.  after all, how serious can i be (or be taken), posing for pictures in a jedi outfit for total strangers?  ;)          ",

They feature people in my everyday-thoughts: it's just that as the dreams progress, they metamorphisize, something about them changes. They grow slits for eyes, they become dismembered. Either this, or they have subtle changes: their hair gets longer, their eyes change color, their height changes. Something always changes. And always, something in the dream is not as it is supposed to be; rather, it defies my everyday outlook upon these same people: for example, people whom I see to be talkative and generally like me become withdrawn and quiet, and it is these that change the most, first with subtlety, and then progressing. Others, whom I see to hate me are my best friends, I've had girlfriends I'd never thought to be as such in these dreams. And it goes the other way too: people I hate, I like them, and vice versa. People die, people get killed in front of me, there tends to be a little shadow that sits in other peoples' shadows and kills them when a conversation or events are starting to get really exciting or someone thinks that they're about to die somehow. And sometimes it's just quiet. And others, it's just standing around talking about random stuff while the people change and other, background people die, or arbitrarily stand there as I and the subject do.  Sorry for drawing this out so much, but these just have to stop. Everytime I wake up from one I sit there and think,  O, it was just a dream , at first, and then I start to think,  Was it? , and that's when the panic starts to set in, and I have to sit in place holding my head and staring out the window, trying to get it out of my brain. Last night's had one good one and three semi-bad ones. The good one had to do with kites and rain and people dressed strangely. The others had to do with that shadow killing off some of my best friends. Yes readers, to sate your curiosity,  all  of you have strangely died in these dreams, they've been going on for the past three weeks or so, and my brain has had enough time to deal a mortal blow to each of you, at least, the ones I know that read this. That, and/or you've been strangely disfigured as the dream goes on, and I must say, you all can turn into some  strange  things.  Cut the shit so I can get some sleep, guys, please? OK, so I'm kidding, it's only mines fault. Just bear with the next few posts, these will go on until the next thing happens, I think, and it always does.   It's never been long before, has it?    "

This is (could be, who knows) an actual letter sent to a man named Ryan  DeVries by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, State of  Michigan.   Wait till you read this guy's response!   SUBJECT: DEQ File No.97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County Dear  Mr.  DeVries:   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that  there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of  property.  You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor  who did the following unauthorized activity:   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream  of Spring Pond.   A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.  A  review of the department's files shows that no permits have been issued.  Therefore, the department has determined that this activity is in violation  of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and  Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being  sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compile Laws, annotated.   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially  failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and flooding at downstream  locations.  We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and  cannot be permitted.  The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist  all activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow  condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the stream  channel.   All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 2002.   Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a  follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff.  Failure to comply  with this request or any further unauthorized activity on the site may result  in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action.  We anticipate  and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter.   Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions.   Sincerely, David L.  Price, District Representative Land and Water Management  Division ___________________________________________________   This is the actual response sent back:   Re: DEQ File No.  97-59-0023; T11N; R10W, Sec.  20; Montcalm County.   Dear Mr.  Price,   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to.  I am the legal landowner but not the Contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson,  Michigan.  A couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of  constructing and maintaining two wood 'debris' dams across the outlet stream  of my Spring Pond.  While I did not pay for, authorize, nor supervise their  dam project, I think they would be highly offended that you call their  skillful use of nature building materials 'debris.' I would like to challenge  your department to attempt to emulate their dam project any time and/or any  place you choose.  I believe I can safely state there is no way you could  ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity,  their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.   As to your request, I do not think the beavers are aware that they must first  fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity.  My first dam question to you is:   (1) Are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers?  or, (2)  do you require all beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam  request?   If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, through the  Freedom of Information Act, I request completed copies of all those other  applicable beaver dam permits that have been issued.  Perhaps we will see if  there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the  Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the PublicActs  of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws,  annotated.   I have several concerns.  My first concern is - aren't the beavers entitled  to legal representation?  The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute  and are unable to pay for said representation- so the State will have to  provide them with a dam lawyer.  The Department's dam concern that either one  or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing flooding is  proof that this is a natural ccurrence, which the Department is required to  protect.   In other words, we should leave the Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than  harass them and call their dam names.  If you want the stream 'restored'to a  dam free-flow condition please contact the beavers, but if you are going to  arrest them, they obviously did not pay any attention to your dam letter;  they being unable to read English.   In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their  unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green and water  flows downstream.  They have more dam rights than I do to live and enjoy  Spring Pond.  If the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental  Protection lives up to its name, it should protect the natural resources  (Beavers) and the environment (Beavers' Dams.).   So, as far as the beavers and I are concerned, this dam case can be referred  for more elevated enforcement action right now.  Why wait until 1/31/2002?  The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then and there will be no  way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then.   In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention to a real  environmental quality (health) problem in the area.  It is the bears!  Bears  are actually defecating in our woods.  I definitely believe you should be  persecuting the defecating bears and leave the beavers alone.  If you are  going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step!  (The bears are not  careful where they dump!)   Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you  on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office.   Very truly yours, Ryan DeVries       "

My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.

I like the rock music of the 70's and 80's since they represent a much simpler and generally more enjoyable time of my life (nostalgia).  I can't stand most of today's music, partly based on lyrics/topics and partly based on the music itself.  I love big band music (Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, et. al) probably because I played alot of that in the jazz bands I was in in high school and college.  But for straight artistry, I love classical music (in the general definition of orchestral music).  Bach, Beethoven Tchaichovsky, Mussorgsky, Rossini, Copland, Wagner, Gershwin, even some Bernstein, and on and on.  When I get a chance and have had a stressful day or week, I lay flat on my back in front of the speakers and listen to some of this music, lose myself in the intricacies of the music and end up feeling much more relaxed and focused.  Sorry for drifting off topic there, but my point was that I had never thought about the fact that my taste in music has not changed much over the years and how that relates to heart and mind.  That would be an interesting study (what do changes in taste of art reflect on the growth of person?)  I bet some doctoral candidate has studied that at some point.         ",

      "1": "              Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            ",

I tend to be rather neurotic, and I've often not been able to understand why my world seems to be in a whirlwind and out of control.  Since undergoing therapy, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (aka manic depression), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  Throughout a lot of this journey, I've tried to learn as much about the mental illnesses as possible to see how and where I fit in.  The idea is to glean from others' knowledge so that I can get well.  I'm currently being seen by a psychiatrist and a counselor, and the diagnosis is what the doc referred to as 'process OCD', which I'm understanding as Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD).  It is true that I have some of the 'content OCD' symptoms: I pick at scabs, touch my face or hands excessively, etc.  But the big thing is that my 'process' of doing things is so rigid.  So I'm journeying to discover more about this OCPD, and, thanks to the folks at Yahoo!, I was able to find a   web site that defines OCPD .  I link to it here more for my benefit, but if you also benefit, then that's a bonus.          ",

    "query_text": "             BIG BABIES   SUV Killers Beg For Mercy  PITTSBURGH--For more than a decade, citizens who drive normal-size cars have been bullied, poisoned and murdered by drivers of sport utility vehicles. Now they're being asked to like it.  'Did My Car Join Al Qaeda?' asks Woody Hochswender in The New York Times. 'Where I live, about 100 miles north of New York City, at least half of all the vehicles you see on the road are SUVs or other light trucks. They make a great deal of sense. This is not just because we have plenty of long, steep driveways and miles and miles of dirt roads.'  'According to their enemies,' writes Walter Kirn in Time magazine, 'SUV drivers aren't just road hogs; they're also sociopaths who are overcompensating for deep-seated feelings of inferiority. I resent being psychoanalyzed this way. I'm after traction, not dominance, O.K.?'  The road hog set is up in arms over TV ads that call their souped-up steroidwagons anti-Christian, anti-American and pro-terrorist. SUVs have had their windows smashed in Washington, been spray-painted with anti-war slogans in Massachusetts and set ablaze by the lot full in Pennsylvania. Environmental groups sell SUV 'tickets,' and bumper stickers that read 'As a matter of fact, I do own the road,' encouraging activists to stick them on the gas hogs.  Opponents call SUVs wasteful, polluting and dangerous to other drivers. Because these fuel-inefficient leviathans now comprise a quarter of new car sales, and big models like the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban only get 12 miles per gallon, all of the air-quality improvements made during the `70s and `80s have been erased. 'But a car's miles-per-gallon rating is only one measure of fuel efficiency,' argues Hochswender. 'Miles driven is another. People who drive light trucks quickly learn not to drive around aimlessly.' He's wrong. There's zero evidence that SUV drivers drive fewer miles than other motorists. And even if some have trained themselves to eliminate frivolous miles, then driving a more efficient vehicle those lesser lengths is an opportunity for further improvement. Consider this startling fact: the SUV is the only reason the United States has been unable to comply with the Kyoto Accord on air pollution.  Even more irritating to non-SUV drivers is the sense of being pushed around--and off--the roads by 9,000-pound gorillas. No one needs the results of a formal 'crash compatibility' test to tell them that their Toyota Corolla will fair poorly in a close encounter with a Ford Expedition. The fact is you're more than twice as likely to die in a crash with an SUV than with another sedan. 'Four-wheel-drive vehicles allow workers to get to and from their jobs, and parents to transport their children safely to school, sporting events, ballet classes and the rest,' defends Hochswender. But every SUV added to the traffic on the road decreases the likelihood of someone else's kids arriving alive at school or ballet class. It's basic physics, the law of conservation of momentum to be exact. SUV drivers increase their own security at the expense of other drivers.  Ironically, it's even worse than that. SUVs not only endanger the occupants of smaller cars--they kill their own drivers in roll-overs at triple the rate of other vehicles, according to Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It's unfortunate if an SUV driver kills himself, but the real issue is what he does to others.  Granted, no consumer is innocent. The Gap T-shirt you buy at the mall is produced by children toiling under exploitative conditions overseas. Microsoft software is packaged by prisoner slave labor. Of course, if you were truly virtuous you'd skip even that sexy hybrid Prius and its holier-than-thou 50 m.p.g. rating and just bike to work. But it's hard to argue with Union of Concerned Scientists director Jason Mark's conclusion that, as socially-responsible purchasing decisions go, SUVs 'represent the worst.'  Short of opening a shooting range next door to a daycare center, buying an SUV is perhaps the single most antisocial act an ordinary American can commit. And as resentment against this egocentrism coalesces into anger, SUV owners are becoming defensive. Kirn again: 'Nothing takes the pleasure out of driving like the suspicion that at every four-way stop, someone in a fuel-efficient compact is sneering at my moral deficiencies. I want to scream, `But I live on a dirt road! I have a farm! See all the mud on my fenders! I need this rig!''  What I would scream back, if I met Kirn, would be this: 'What did you people do 20 years ago?' Back in the days before SUVs, farmers drove pick-ups and the rest of us drove cars. The soccer mom with a gaggle of kids drove a low stationwagon or slow minivan. Nowadays, the overwhelming majority of SUVs are plying our highways and suburban streets. Fewer than one percent will ever be driven off-road.  Why are SUV owners surprised that nobody likes them? Americans have long defined themselves by the cars they drive; is it unreasonable to assume that someone who drives an oversized gas guzzler is a selfish, aggressive lout? People buy SUVs because they're imposing, so they can see over smaller cars. Is it shocking that drivers whose sight lines are blocked by these hulking machines, and who are blinded at night by the headlights of great overbearing tailgaters, are resentful?  More and more SUV drivers are coming out of stores to find their vehicles 'keyed,' stickered or worse, and SUVs are replacing fur coats as the spray paint target of choice. Sure it sucks, but can SUV owners complain? Vandalizing property is a mere misdemeanor next to willfully endangering other people's lives and hastening the demise of the planet.  'What are we supposed to do now, turn our SUVs in?' asks Hochswender. Well, yeah. And quit whining because everybody hates you.    - Ted Rall           ",

      "3": "              Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            ",

      "2": "           r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.         ",
      "3": "           To clarify:  I said the Bush administration *had* a strong case, but exchanged it for weaker one.  Based on the original argument, I support a (brief and decisive) war with full and fair closure for Iraq.  The second (and current) argument, which has added that Saddam is evil to his people, that Iraq as a country is a direct threat to us, that we want to rescue the Iraqi people, is nonsense to me; there are many evil leaders, Iraq is an *in*direct threat by way of terrorists (re: original argument), and there are millions of people all over the world who are oppressed whom we don't 'rescue.'  To me, these arguments fail to support war, and adding them to the original argument has clouded the issue and left me unsatisfied.  I am left supporting the war for a compelling reason that has since been buried under what sells on TV.  I feel like I'm at a football game where I'm cheering for my school because I want us in the championships, while everyone around me is cheering for my school because they hate the opposing coach.  I don't care about the other coach.  I can't join in and cheer as loudly under those conditions.  As to the argument that terrorists will keep coming at us until we make it unsafe for them to operate, etc.:  as I stated before, I believe this is only half right.  If fights break out at the roadhouse because everyone's high on drugs, and we respond by arresting everyone and shutting down the roadhouse, sure there will be no more fights.  But the drugs will move to another roadhouse.  And we don't have the resources nor the will to eliminate all roadhouses, then all bars, then all clubs, then, then, then....  If we don't address the reason in some way, the only sure solution is the arresting or killing of all violent Muslims, throughout the world.  Good luck managing that.  This enemy isn't a Nazi government, a country to be contained.  They're individual people, full of anger they feel is justified, who can wander about freely like ants.  It would be mighty (darkly) funny if we elminated all WMD throughout the world, and the day after we declared victory, some random fellow got lucky and piloted a hijacked airliner into the Lake Anna nuclear plant.  For that matter, after WMDs are eliminated, what's next -- fertilizer?  If our only response is to neutralize them, we had better kill them all, every last one, quickly, utterly, completely, and erase them forever from the history books so that all their relatives and descendents will forget they ever existed.

At first I had thought we were counted down on teamwork because of my showoffishness...then I remembered Franklin's 'Harp Girl', who did almost the same thing. So I guess it was simply that we were first, and set as a standard against the rest. That definitely contributed to our downfall...well, perhaps that's too strong of a word. With our work, we could've had first.  I must say, 'GO TEAM!', we were fraggin' GREAT compared to the beginning, where we figured we were going to be slaughtered and abdicated from a mere shot at state.

He said to the officer, 'May I go, Sir, and bring him in?'  But the officer refused.  'No one can live out there,' he said.  'I will only lose you as well.'  Disobeying the order, the man went to try to save his friend, for they had been like David and Jonathan throughout the entire war.  Somehow, he got his friend on his shoulder and carried him back to the trenches, but he himself lay mortally wounded, and his friend was dead.  The officer was angry.

The boy shrank from the reproach, but, looking up at his officer's face, he said, 'It  was  worth it, Sir, because when I got to him, he said, 'I knew you'd come.''    from a plaque I saw in Linda R.'s bathroom           ",

Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:   iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the   old  and   new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

I found him groggy and cute when he's sleepy -- not to mention sore and not a little grouchy. Been in LA for the past 2 weeks, training 600 security screeners. The Admiral who's the Federal Security Director here has gone on record saying he wants a total of 1100 trained by the end of the year, so doing the math, that means that there's another, um, carry the one, er, 500 screeners to cycle through in the next 2 weeks. Wheeeee!  Thought I'd write a bit about my day off for Benji's bene -- I was able to pull off one of my favorite things today: the Movie Theater Hat Trick!! Paid money for 'Drumline,' used my free pass (see details below) to get into 'Die Another Day,' then walked across the hall into 'Nemesis' -- an altogether entertaining way to blow an entire day!! My butt's asleep and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, but it was good to get a movie fix.  So it started at 11:00 this morning with 'Drumline.' The movie was 30 minutes late starting because the moved the theater but forgot to tell the projectionist. Oops. The entire audience was up in arms, to say the least (they didn't even turn off the flood lights in the theater until 10 minutes after the showtime) and the manager avoided a riot only by offering refunds or free passes to the entire crowd. Serendipitously, the 30 minute delay worked perfectly, as the Bond film was starting at 1:30. Once done there, 'Nemesis' was only 10 minutes from kickoff, so it was an easy jaunt across the hall!  Opinions  Drumline:  A marching band geek's wet dream. Nearly half an hour of drumline battles, marching band formations, and get-down moves. It would have been very comical if the Lee-Davis marching Confederates tried to do what these bands were hammering out, but it was fun to fantasize about belonging to a band like that. They nailed the internal band politics, too. Definitely worth matinee price, or video viewing at JS' with his monster sound system. A must see if you salivate at the sound of a drumline cadence.  Die Another Day:  I can't say enough how much I enjoy Pierce B.'s James. He manages to make him human, and gives him an edge that Connery had in the early films but Moore could never find. I truly believe that his JB is a cold-blooded killer. Halle Berry, however, never quite convinced me that she was cut from the same cloth. Not that I'm complaining, but she swishes when she moves and it prevents me from believing that she's a hard-edged operative. And Rosamund Pike makes me feel all funny inside and (heh, heheh) my pants got tight when she was on the screen....  Nemesis:  Solid, but not filling. Action-packed, but not 'Khan.' I think my lack of enthusasim is a result of a good thing -- that is, I've seen all the battle scenes on TV -- they aren't breaking ground in that department. Good, since I can get my ship-to-ship action fix on TV, but bad because it leaves me wishing I would be blown away on the big screen. Great villan for this one, but I HATED the whole Data thing. If the next one is 'Search for Data,' I quit (and you know they set that up, too)! I just can't help but think that Berman has wrung the franchise dry. Anybody keeping up with 'Enterprise,' please contradict me and convince me that I'm wrong.  That's all from the Left coast. Hope everyone has a Peaceful holiday!         ",

When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             ",

The song  Between Times  has come back for me again, and now the words are getting to me, now that I understand them; after, of course, reading them on a website,   darklyrics.com , which includes the wonderful band Bal-Sagoth, with wonderful titles such as  In The Raven Haunted Forests Of Darkmier Where The Sun Does Not Shine And The Trees Eternally Choke The Light  or something to that effect, times every song on their album. But that is besides the point.  'The drums of time have stopped, the ecstatic quietude,' and I feel it, this quietude that drove me to a strange feeling this summer, and over Leigh Anne this year, it is the force, the demon, upon my shoulders that tells me to keep fighting and to make things so much worse than they are. It is a strange fate for one that could want so much from people and, in the end, with his demon, leave little to be desired.  This quiet hasn't yet settled back in, but with enough time it will. It doesn't readily trouble me as of yet; rather, I feel its fingers and feel the breath of its whispers. It never hurts me, only it works on me until I forget who I am.  But mostly, I feel it because I see its poison working its way out of me and on to those around me as repercussions of my actions. Scorn, mostly, well deserved, but scorn nonetheless. To whom it may concern:  Whether or not your actions are deserved of my contempt are unbeknownst to me, simply I am the messenger of voices I have held back far too long, voices that I believe to be true, and not voices of my own conception, these are other people I have held back again and again. The conflict has dissolved to loyalties now, truly; there can be no middle ground for you and I, make well known this, without someone else's dissention. Be aware that there was a reason for the things I have done, and a reason for why I keep you away now.  I have come to a point in life where there is a parting of paths, 'now that there is no good escape', the paths have forked, and now I sit at the crossing of the roads and wonder as to which I shall take now. And perhaps, to go back, and see how far I have come...or perhaps, not to go at all, as it seems to me that the agony is upon everyone else and not myself at this point...although the wolves stalk at the sun sets...or rather, I cannot stay in one place too long and be safe.  Over anything, I wish I could be the totally uncomplicated me, not this romantic prodigy, shaped by society and its nuances and projections of love, love, that tepid desire, oh greatest and most destructive creation of man, the want of other humans, that which finally did bring us out from shadow, the essence of love.  Love is actually not a human invention...the concepts behind it are, but as for the emotion, a product of (creation? evolution?) existence. And, sadly and sorrowfully, and especially for me, who would resist it as of now, it is inevitable.  And thus the sun sets on another age and my understanding of the nature of life goes blurry again, a wheel of color, and I, to focus on one color and see what it may bring, be it love, be it conflict with the world, be it conflict at home, be it the same color as before, and the story as of now continues, the neverending chronicles of a man stricken with nameless emotions that interferes with all that he does...or perhaps, a modified version of that tale, where he has control of his existence.  Sorry for all the symbolism, somehow it tends to well up in periods of intense thought, as I am having now, and later, when I read through all of this, I can at least make a bit of sense out of it.  Blurry, love, struggle, it all comes around.  Again, that is.    "

He says he likes the idea of a restricted space and our bodies being really close. We don't own a bunk bed, but I really want to make it come true for him. Do you have any ideas or suggestions? Bride To Be  Your fianc wants to have sex in a 'restricted space' with your bodies 'really close.' Where and how were you having sex before his big confession? In the middle of a football field with you in one end zone and him in the other?  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so.  I'm sorry, BTB, but your fianc is NOT into bunk-bed sex. He's lying to you, dumbass. No one with a fantasy life that dull requires 'several gentle conversations' to draw him out! There's nothing the least bit shameful, gross, freaky, or repulsive about sex in a bed, bunk or otherwise. Therefore, there's only one conclusion we can draw from your boyfriend's big confession: He's hiding something.  The first few times you engaged him in gentle conversation, he stalled and hemmed and hawed, and you dropped the subject. If he didn't have any fantasies, he would have said so, but he didn't say that, did he? So he clearly has some fantasies he was too ashamed to reveal. Then, when it became clear that you wouldn't stop pestering him until he told you something, he made something up. Something safe. Something innocuous. Something that wouldn't scare you off. Something like, oh, 'I wanna have sex in a bunk bed.' Something that, if it were true, he would have told you during that first gentle conversation.  What your fianc really wants, BTB, is to be peed on or suck the snot out of your nose or blacken your eyes or wear diapers. Or all at once. Or worse. But, hey, have sex in a bunk bed if you think he's telling you the truth. You can order a cheap one from Ikea and fuck on it until it falls apartabout three fucks should do it. But consider yourself warned: He's hiding something big, and you might want to find out what it is before you marry bunk-bed boy.           ",

      "2": "           If you move past the debate of whether or not the project is needed or if the benefits out weigh the costs/impacts, then we design the projects with human safety as the number one criteria.  The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?  The US Army Corps of Engineers.  How's that for irony?         ",

This time I didn't miss on purpose: I got home at about seven and a half, whereafter my mum reminded me that she had to go to work in Nashville. Technically, I could have gone with her and taken the car back to Franklin, but that would require me paying for the gas at some point, and then having to drive back at rushhour and pick her up. Which doesn't diminish me being a bastard any less, I'm so sorry Rosie. I'll give you the printed booklet with calligraphic lettering for the 'high in vitamins and minerals, 100% delicious!/we're poor' demos. That's the name of this fourteen song wonder. At least, that was the name I put on it while sitting in the parking lot of BUMC this morning.   Three talking tracks and a coupla myuzik tracks. And more to come soon, as my drum teacher gave me the right cables I needed to make the drums sound totally L337. It's only a matter of time now, then you can all claim to know a rockstar...eagh, I dun wanna go.  I was just reading this backlogs on The Blog...memories! They're all their now so check 'em out all. God, where was I all that time? I read over the posts and it was like, 'did all of this really happen?'. I've read them all before, but whatever, I'm just a dumb kid.  I did some major photography work today. I mainly wanted to waste the rest of the pics on there so I can get this reel developed and get the pics of my wonderful, beloved Loser Girlfriend. But there's other cool pics in there too. Like the token self-shot, I just aimed the camera and clicked. Those always turn out...interesting. And how about the one of my pocket, where I was talking to Abby about cool shots that just turn out cool, and then proceeded to take one of the innards of my pocket, that was a good one. And then the art shots, like the inside of the piano.  Alex and I wanted to do some interesting concept art for  Ignorance . Alex wanted a picture of two hands together, one reading 'Ignorance' and the other, 'Arrogance', because the two go hand in hand. I did this picture today, using a Sharpie and a red dry erase marker. To take the pic I mounted it on one of my amps, poised my hands in front of the lens, and used my tongue to hit the shutter release. It was a great shot.   Then I did some. One is of a rusted and cracked knife that's been used lately...in blood, running down the blade is the word 'BLEED', which comes up several times on the album and would probably justify the effort as thematical in nature.   I did another 'hands' picture, which was full of symbolism. It depicts my hand with the word 'IGNORANCE' in red, reminiscent of blood, of course. I painted my nails with one coat of black and then quickly rubbed it off, so the nails have the look of death or something, it's really creeped out. And, the hand is clawed, as if in agony. This whole scene is supposed to represent three important themes. One: PAIN, the clawed hand, the wound that reads 'IGNORANCE', the word pain comes up several times, and it is the result of ignorance. Two: BLEED, the red colour of IGNORANCE, what it feels like to be ignored, having those codependant whims as I once had. Three: IGNORANCE, the total picture, an etching of blood in the hand, the clawed grip and deadened nails, the whole scene is reminiscent of pain and punishment. The total psychology of the picture, tho, will tell you that the person therein did not deserve whatever pain he/she was getting, and thusly leads everyone to feel the anger and stuff.  I also came up with some really good lines and two useable songs today. I haven't name one of them, the other is named  Wrecked , and it sounds a lot like  Broken Me , lots of rhythm singing and whatnot, and some really messed guitar and bass...I was trippin' on Nirvana's  I Hate Myself and Want To Die  when I wrote it. And notice, the one word song title. I've been doing that a lot lately...some of the most recent song names  Soak ,  Feeder ,  Down ...then others, like  I'm Just A Bastard ,  The Schizophrenic Song , and  Grandpa Was a Schoolbus Driver , not to mention that wonderful classic,  EBAMahickey , which is going to be totally revamped at some point, so that we can talk about the Ebamahickey ripping through sinews, muscle, and bones at 9107349817320941293481623049 plus decibles. I love being a rock guy.  I'm sorry to bore all of you with this crap, guys. Agh. I just love talking about this wonderful band stuff. I'll admit, it's really boring to everyone else, but it's something else watching everything take shape as it is now.  I'm going to shut up and go to bed now. Ciao for niao buddies.     "

Vin Diesel is a horrible actor, but that line was fantastic in that movie.  Life screws everybody; I'm sort of a nihilist, so I have a belief that the basis of life is simply having problems. The second part of that, however, the non-nihilist half, says that life is also about dealing with and overcoming problems. Yes, it took me about...eight months now to formulate that belief, and a lot of emotional detailing and rearrangement and stuff, but it seems to be working very well for me.  Love is the last thing left? Tell that to the people  burning in hell . Muhahahahaha.  O yeah B-wood hoods, today on the bus, Brittany called Lizzie back and left a heathenistic message, imitating me. God, that girl. Thereafter, I call'd her and left a message. And then the shit hit the fan. I gave my cousin Seth Lizzie's number, whereafter he called and left a message confessing his undying love to her. Then she called me and asked if it was I who had left that message, I said no, she said, 'OK, bye, sorry,' Then, Seth managed to get the number from me via stealing my cell and taking the number off of it; he then left several messages asking her to get married, and eventually breaking up with her. Once he called the wrong number and asked some random lady out, via voicemail. He left his number on that one, and after it was over, I told him, 'Dude, you just left your number,' He just stared at me for a moment, and then called Lizzie back.  Uhoh, she was getting pissed after these, say, eight messages. She called my grandmother's and Seth answered. He started asking her questions, and someone Seth got our of her that  Leigh Anne was getting her to call me and leave these messages . So with a look of mild shock on my face, I tried to take the phone, listening in on Seth trying to get her to talk to me:  'So do you wanna talk to Josh?' 'No,' 'Why?' 'Because he's an asshole!'  Oops, everyone hates me. I picked up the next time she called and, while Seth was busy pledging his love to/breaking up with Lizzie, I was asking her how she got my number; through Leigh, who was asking her to leave messages.  I don't think she'll leave anymore though. She's getting really screwed up over Seth calling a thousand times.  Silly smart people at MLK, all full of themselves.      ",

Then we went to the pharmacist to get our prescriptions filled, again paying out of our own pocket: $181 for three prescriptions, two of which were not available in generic form.  Because my mom receives MedicAid for her medical stuff, her office visit and medicine didn't cost us any out-of-pocket money.  Nevertheless, I was a bit upset for having to pay so much for medical care, and I prayed on the way home for God to help me be grateful that we even had the money and access to the medical care.  I also prayed for the medicine to do its job.  Ultimately, God is in control, and I need to trust in him.  I guess that is one of the biggest things I am learning in my life:  that I need to concentrate on the stuff that I can handle and leave the rest up to God.

For example --  I dreamt yesterday that I'd driven this white compact car in England, and somehow the tires got slashed.  I didn't have any money to get the repairs done, and I panicked.  Fortunately, I was in the small town where Paul McCartney and his family lived.  In fact, his mother lived in a historic house with several historic vehicles in the parking lot.  I found my way to this house, and I learned that Paul's Mum was living off a huge trust that her deceased husband had bequeathed her.  I was allowed to stay at this house for a time.  I desperately wanted to get back to the States, but I needed help getting my passport and other things.  Then I learned how deep the McCartney family politics went.  I learned that one of Paul's brothers had gotten into some trouble with a neighboring clan from another town.  The problem was so deep that the head of this family was wanting one of their family to marry one if Paul's, in return for the calamity.  For some reason, the two clans each had distinguishing symbols on their right cheeks, corresponding to their respective families.  One way for me to get out of the country, I found out, was to take the place of this McCartney brother who was in trouble.  (I don't really remember if I was already married or not.)  After I reluctantly agreed, they helped me get set up so that I would pass as a member of the McCartney family.  I recall a scene at a train station in which they handed me my wedding clothes to change into.  I made my way to the men's room and did so.  I then remember driving to this mansion where I would meet my bride-to-be.  And that's all I can remember.         ",

      "1": "           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

That may be, but there are problems with simplisticly removing the sources of their anger.    Keep in mind that Israel was founded by the UN in 1947 or 1948.  Yes, the existing inhabitants (now known as Palestinians, though there was not a Palestine at that time)were forced out of their homes, but you could (and I am very hesitant to do so because of the obvious implications to the US concerning Native American Indians) point out that the Israelis were driven out of that land that had been theirs for 2000 years.  Additionally, the occupied territories were occupied because the Arab countries have attacked Israel 2 or 3 times and lost.  Israel took those lands to offer additional protection from future attack.  I could be wrong, but I think that technically, a state of war still exists between Israel and Syria, meaning that Israel would be idiotic to surrender the Golan Heights (very strategic land) back to Syria.  In the ultimate irony, the radical Palestinians and Arabs want to drive the Israelis into the sea and exterminate them.  Do you recall the fighting in Kosovo a few years ago?  The Serbs (Christians) were trying to wipe out the Kosovars (Muslims).  Kind of ironic that we (USA/NATO) stopped the ethnic cleansing there, yet religiously related people want us to turn a blind eye and let them wipe out Jews.  As for Saudi Arabia, we may be 'spoiling' sacred lands in the eyes of some Muslims, but we are there at the request and with the permission of the Saudi Royal Family (government).  If the extermists want us gone that bad, then they should petition for a change in their governments policy.  We don't generally stay where the government does not want us to be.  Caving in to the actions of terrorists will set a very bad example for future events.  What happens when the hypothetical pure Islamic nation existis, stretching from Tunisia to Pakistan and Turkey to Sudan, and they then decide that their Eurpoean  or Indian neighbors are living the corrupt lives of infidels.

Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         ",

      "3": "           i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used 'for missions targeting the United States.'  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           ",

    "query_text": "           A Citizen's Appeal to a General in a Time of War (at Home)   September 12, 2003      Dear General Wesley Clark,   I've been meaning to write to you for some time. Two days after the Oscars, when I felt very alone and somewhat frightened by the level of hatred toward me for daring to suggest that we were being led into war for 'fictitious reasons,' one person stuck his neck out and came to my defense on national television.    And that person was you.   Aaron Brown had just finished interviewing me by satellite on CNN, and I had made a crack about me being 'the only non-general allowed on CNN all week.' He ended the interview and then turned to you, as you were sitting at the desk with him. He asked you what you thought of this crazy guy, Michael Moore. And, although we were still in Week 1 of the war, you boldly said that my dissent was necessary and welcome, and you pointed out that I was against Bush and his 'policies,' not the kids in the service. I sat in Flint, Mich., with the earpiece still in my ear and I was floored -- a GENERAL standing up for me and, in effect, for all the millions who were opposed to the war but had been bullied into silence.   Since that night, I have spent a lot of time checking you out. And what I've learned about you corresponds to my experience with you back in March. You seem to be a man of integrity. You seem not afraid to speak the truth. I liked your answer when you were asked your position on gun control: 'If you are the type of person who likes assault weapons, there is a place for you -- the United States Army. We have them.'   In addition to being first in your class at West Point, a four-star general from Arkansas, and the former supreme commander of NATO -- enough right there that should give pause to any peace-loving person -- I have discovered that ...   1. You oppose the PATRIOT Act and would fight the expansion of its powers.   2. You are firmly pro-choice.   3. You filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action case.   4. You would get rid of the Bush tax 'cut' and make the rich pay their fair share.   5. You respect the views of our allies and want to work with them and with the rest of the international community.   6. And you oppose war. You have said that war should always be the 'last resort' and that it is military men such as yourself who are the most for peace because it is YOU and your soldiers who have to do the dying. You find something unsettling about a commander in chief who dons a flight suit and pretends to be Top Gun, a stunt that dishonored those who have died in that flight suit in the service of their country.   General Clark, last night I finally got to meet you in person. I would like to share with others what I said to you privately: You may be the person who can defeat George W. Bush in next year's election.   This is not an endorsement. For me, it's too early for that. I have liked Howard Dean (in spite of his flawed positions in support of some capital punishment, his grade 'A' rating from the NRA, and his opposition to cutting the Pentagon budget). And Dennis Kucinich is so committed to all the right stuff. We need candidates in this race who will say the things that need to be said, to push the pathetically lame Democratic Party into having a backbone -- or get out of the way and let us have a REAL second party on the ballot.   But right now, for the sake and survival of our very country, we need someone who is going to get the job done, period. And that job, no matter whom I speak to across America -- be they leftie Green or conservative Democrat, and even many disgusted Republicans -- EVERYONE is of one mind as to what that job is:   Bush must go.   This is war, General, and it's Bush & Co.'s war on us. It's their war on the middle class, the poor, the environment, their war on women and their war against anyone around the world who doesn't accept total American domination. Yes, it's a war -- and we, the people, need a general to beat back those who have abused our Constitution and our basic sense of decency.   The General vs. the Texas Air National Guard deserter! I want to see that debate, and I know who the winner is going to be.   The other night, when you were on Bill Maher's show, he began by reading to you a quote from Howard Dean where he (Dean) tried to run away from the word 'liberal.' Maher said to you, so, General, do you want to run away from that word? Without missing a beat, you said 'No!' and you reminded everyone that America was founded as a 'liberal democracy.' The audience went wild with applause.   That is what we have needed for a long time on our side -- guts. I am sure there are things you and I don't see eye to eye on, but now is the time for all good people from the far left to the middle of the road to bury the damn hatchet and get together behind someone who is not only good on the issues but can beat George W. Bush. And where I come from in the Midwest, General, I know you are the kind of candidate that the average American will vote for.   Michael Moore likes a general? I never thought I'd write these words. But desperate times call for desperate measures. I want to know more about you. I want your voice heard. I would like to see you in these debates. Then let the chips fall where they may -- and we'll all have a better idea of what to do. If you sit it out, then I think we all know what we are left with.   I am asking everyone I know to send an e-mail to you now to encourage you to run, even if they aren't sure they would vote for you. (Wesley Clark's e-mail address is: info@leadershipforamerica.org.) None of us truly know how we will vote five months from now or a year from now. But we do know that this race needs a jolt -- and Bush needs to know that there is one person he won't be able to Dukakisize.   Take the plunge, General Clark. At the very least, the nation needs to hear what you know about what was really behind this invasion of Iraq and your fresh ideas of how we can live in a more peaceful world. Yes, your country needs you to perform one more act of brave service -- to help defeat an enemy from within, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, an address that used to belong to 'we, the people.'

We've had reason to suspect that she's lost more hearing.  Our suspicions were correct; she has lost even more hearing.  The audiologist was able to boost her hearing aids to their maximum capacity.  She has encouraged us to have the ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist) check Keisha out again.  She also has advised us to begin considering a cochlear implant(CI) for Keisha.  I'm not sure if you know what a CI involves, but I'll give you a little bit of info.  Basically, a surgeon drills a hole in Keisha's head and attaches an electrode to her auditory nerve.  Once that heals over, she then gets fitted with a magnet that attaches to her head an leads to a receiver in her ear.  The receiver looks a little like a hearing aid.  There's probably a website I could direct you to, but I don't have the link right now.  Please pray for us.  We're considering getting a second opinion, but we're also recognizing that this direction may be where we have to go.  Love in Christ,  Dan, Jennie, and Keisha          ",
      "1": "           Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of 'fashion,' which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

      "2": "           Nick - According to the book, what was the most scandalous thing going on?  I don't have time to read much anymore, and have never really read any non-fiction political books.  I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.  Who was supposed to running it?         ",

      "1": "           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

The song  Black  was a nice depressing ballad through the last couple of rainy days; there's a piano in it and it somehow reminds me of rain. And, my dad was playing this album non-stop during the carefree days of five years old...ELEVEN FUCKING YEARS AGO...and it reminds me of that, as well.  Rosie brought up today that this whole 'I'm not being me' thing has happened before. I agree. I think that it's just a stupid and bad thing I always do when I'm met with new situations: I try to adapt to everything more than I need to, and I end up bludgeoning everything in the wake of aftermath, and knocking holes in everyone, not disincluding myself.   Lord, this remind me of last year, sitting here making stupid EMO posts for hours. Honeybunches of oats. That's my new curse.  And speaking of EMO...I started an EMO band care of Billy Bassett. We were talking about how I look like Cousin It with my hair all in my face, and then we were talking about how cool EMO is, and then I was like...'Dude...that's the name of my EMO band...Cousin It.' And Billy said it was a great name. So. I'm going to start writing EMO songs now! Woo! I'm an EMO kid and I hate my life. And you dumped me in the fifth grade...so I'm gonna make me die.  That would be the name of my production company, too.  I'm Gonna Kill Me  Music, in case anyone wants me to produce them. Oh hell. I'm not really concerned with that right now.

America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'     -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          ",

Yeh, so I have nothing else to write.  Oh yeh, I was making these cookies and my dad came in and was looking for something to eat for dessert.  Well, he wanted a cookie, but I told him no.  So, he goes for the twix bar we have in the pantry.  He starts complaining, so I tell him that he should have the twix ice cream instead.  Well, apparently he can't have that cause it's full fat.  Aren't those two items the same thing pretty much?  I'm confused, cause neither is reduced fat in the first place, yet the ice cream has full fat.  Whatever.        "

I'll come back to that.  This thing with Calhoun did not start this, it only confirmed it.   Today, I had a really bad day. It wasn't the saddening kind that makes me think suicide. Quite the contrary. This was a day that is going to change my life, it was so bad. I was not depressed. I realized that I was fucking horribly mad. More than mad, I was homocidal. I joke about it a lot, but mark me, MARK ME, I was thinking about taking a baseball bat over to that stupid whore's house and finishing the job her ex didn't. And mark me on that one, too. This is all going to come to a point, I promise, but there's going to be a ton of malice beforehand. I said do with it what you will, and I hope that you'll do just that.  Actually, I didn't get homocidal until about a hour ago. Beforehand I was complacent, I was stoic. I sat back and got pissed but I didn't blow up. I always do that. Like I told Abby earlier tonight, I was just 'on a low simmer'. But for some reason this one just wouldn't stay there. I blew up a couple of minutes ago. I started banging things, and Katie was laughing and so was I. I didn't think I was serious when I was saying, GOD I'M SO FUCKING MAD. But then I felt great. Why?  I felt great because I accept the reality of my situation. I've been repressing it. I don't know why. I came down to earth and said what the mother fuck I really felt about it, and I embraced the godawful truth of it. It's that I am so fucking sick of being complacent and respectful to these dickheads that are going to fuck around with me, like that stupid whore, and like Julian, and this other kid I just heard about, pulling some shit.  I figured something else out. I figured out how much complacency I have with the cycle of abuses. You know how people do? First, things are going ok, you think it's all alright and whatnot, and you trust the person. Then they start to slip and pull some shit. And then...then they just come out and abuse openly, and they don't care what the fuck you have to say about it. And THEN, and here's the good part, they try to make up for it, and mostly, THOSE FUCKING CUNTS GET THE FUCK AWAY WITH IT!!!! ALWAYS!!!! And why is that? Because we all remember how good it used to be, and we figure they'll change, so we give them another chance, and another and another, and we convince ourselves that they actually are good people and that their bad, abusive sides really aren't what they are.   I'VE GIVEN IN TO THEM!!! WE ALL HAVE!!! I ALWAYS give in to Calhoun! I ALWAYS give in to shit, because I'm in love with the ideal, rather than reality!! I fucking hate reality! I don't live here! And therein lies the problem.  I've given up trying to exist in this world. I let the complacent side get the better of me. And I know I have, and so I have some apologies to give out later. But I gave up, and I let this dumbass motherfucker take over, this thing that I'm not. This thing that doesn't think for himself, he thinks for everyone else. He doles out advice but he can't ever adhere to any. I just gave up a long time ago, but suddenly, I'm back. Thanks, Calhoun.  And so, I need you all to meet this person I gave up on because he was too perverted, too coarse, too vulgar. He was the thing I talked about in that song,  I'm Just A Bastard .  He's me.  I've tried so long to keep him back, and I don't know why. Maybe I thought that everyone couldn't accept him, but now I know...everyone just has to, or they just have to leave me be.   So now: I need to tell the ones that have to hear this how incredibly sorry I am that I've been the one pulling the shit and blinding you towards the real me. I'll detail all the circumstances and then you'll know...perhaps you have known. Whatever the case, I need to tell you, the real me does, the one that has occasional and guiltless bad thoughts, and thinks that some shit really is gay, and really wants to take some people out.  And I want you all to know right here and now: I am not blaming ANY of you for ANY of this. I don't want to hear an 'I'm sorry' over any of this, this is TOTALLY not any of your faults. This is something I have done to myself, entirely. It could be said that your actions influenced it...don't think that either. It's how I stupidly interpreted them. If there's one thing I can't stress enough, it's to keep being yourselves. I'm preaching it, yes, and right now I'm going to adhere to it.   Please, don't take any of this the wrong way. I've felt it growing like a tangible presence since...god knows when. But it's been there since I can remember, and I finally figured out what it was, and am in the process of dealing with it.  Linds was right when she said, 'the longer you wait the harder it will be', but I mean more than just with Calhoun. I've been waiting so damned long and not admitting to myself that I have a pretty fucking bad problem that it's turned into a nearly-impossible-to-resolve crisis. But I'm going to handle this. I hope I don't scare any of you away.  I just can't keep him in anymore. All I ask is that you allow me to let him come out.  So tomorrow...'fuck her feelings'. In case I get suspended or do something really stupid and not like me, you all will know why because...I'm telling you. If she's going to get righteous with me, then fuck-a-hootenanny, I'm going to get righteous and then fucking some. I won't get fucking pissed on again, ever. Mark that shit, too.  No more abuses. 'I wonder when all the abuses became commonplace.' It just boggles me how hard I was trying NOT to think about them.  I'm sorry for this post, and I'm sorry for what might follow. But I just can't do the way I'm doing, for fear of losing my fucking mind.   Please bear with me as I try to heal all this damage I've caused. I'm so sorry to all of you I've hurt by this, whether you've noticed or not, I don't know what I can do to make it better. Hell, I don't know how to forgive myself yet.  Please forgive me. I'm sorry.      "

I'm working on a story for Elftown. I figure since I'm taking up space with my presence there, I might as well contribute a little, with the best thing I know how to do in the way of art...writing. It was a pretty crazy idea, but I came up with it in the shower this morning (as I do with all crazy ideas). To write the history of man through the eyes of God. Of course, God is a cynic and thinks all human ideas and religions have completely lost it. He toys with his power, he explains the concept of creation and reason for the world's greatest disasters: the Flood, the Black Plague, the Holocaust, and so on, he explains his own creation and the creation of the universe in the best way he knows how...which is, of course, not at all.   It won't be very long. Mostly, it will show coincidences between the plane of God and the mortal realm, and why God think about things the way he does. You might be thinking, 'This is probably some staidly religious story, isn't it?' Let me assure you, if God isn't the way he is in this story, and more in the biblical vein of God, I'm going to fry forever. But it's a great idea, I think. Who'd have ever though of the story of the world from the vantage point of the one who made it...slightly twisting commonly accepted ideals about God, however that may be.  This might take a little longer than I thought, though. It's sort of hard to make God sound assured of his power without being overly cocky. I just need to make him sound like he  knows  he is badass, because he is.   And trust in this, it's hard to do it without lapsing into a few lines of God's laughing uproariously at humanity, because it sounds like he's on the verge of it in this story most of the time.    "

Kind of ironic, when one considers how much a certain party insists on using language that suggests that they, and the country, are...the servant of God.

Both sound good to a point, but then they drop off into the la-la land of kneejerk idealistic political party lockstepping -- I follow along for a while, nodding in agreement, until it suddenly seems to me as if out of nowhere the proponent whips out his or her ideological dick and starts waving it around.

To public pronouncements?  To sanctions?  To the nation's border?  To physical intervention?  It seems that if it is true that we should have physically prevented the looting of the museums (which would have required wounding and killing many civilians on the building steps), then we should have sent special forces in to stop the destruction in Afghanistan.  What troubles me in a greater sense is that in all the debate about this situation and its implications, many of us are inspired to draw definite lines of principle without thinking just where those lines stop and start.  For example:  If we invaded Iraq to liberate the oppressed, why aren't we planning for the next operation elsewhere in the world?  There are plenty of targets.  If we should not have invaded Iraq because it was about oil, then would anyone have ever been able to stop daily rape, torture, and terror within its borders?  I hear a lot of absolutes, but not a whole lot of thinking.  We seem to prefer a world in bright, contrasting colors, drawn in broad, clear strokes, rather than the contradictory mess it actually is.  We seem to fight for easy definitions rather than face up to the unruly reality.

I was kinda like 'oops.' And went to my mommy, who for the first time in my life, didn't have a band-aid, so I had to go to the lady who was at the little cart rental place, like, 5 feet from the display.

Here I sit clicking my life gone once again, ever acknowledging with each and every breath in the Turkish philosophy sense of the words, that I am dying this very minute, and that every breath I exhale, and everytime the blood in my heart delivers that wonderous life-giving oxygen to the rest of my body, every goddamned time, it's inevitably meaning one more stroke of the steel to the flesh, one more beat that causes this flesh irrevocable damage, the beat shall never return, the damage, however small, is leading us onward inevitably towards that black, aching pit called death with no light, no future, no sounds. Only silence and the grim realization that the past, just as the future and the present, are truly nothing. That the very whim of creation was to take life and let it make choices, mostly ones that would destroy it, and then lead it to black at the end of its time, from whence it came, and where it all will inevitably wind up.  Death.  It feels the same way at this moment, as it did when I put my mouth on the end of that 45 and dropped that goddamned baggage for a few seconds, the wonderous beauty of liberation, and the horror of clarity, that life is a pit, and we are the bastards deemed to find the bottom, in life or without life, but inevitably, we will reach the bottom; some of us will taste it before we meet it, and some of us will hit it before the rest of ourselves can catch up. Some of us just weren't meant to see the clear and the wonderful I hear about. Some of us are made to prematurely taste the bottom because nature says there has to be a balance. If the world were without people that weren't fixated on their own destruction, it would mean a race of people engaging nature and fully working against it, a species that would inevitably rise above the confines of nature.  They put the ones alive on the bottom here so that we are inhibited as a whole, not all of us will unite, we are the ones to show everyone else their own eventual damnation. We were put here to circumvent rising above nature, and nature does this by utilizing our most potent and, in the man-beast sense of the word, only tool: our very minds. Our minds were bred of destruction for survival, the art of survival is destruction. Some of us may only compensate for the full awareness of our inevtiable demise by cutting ourselves in the mental sense, thereby achieving equalibrium again: you cut, you rise back above, you sink back down. Balance through imbalance.  Yet nature doesn't take into account that its scales may be unevely weighted. Equalibrium comes with acceptance: we have a choice to accept this middle ground or not, which, sadly, a great few of us do not, and of those great few, there are varying degrees of non-acceptance. Many who believe themselves to be upon the middle ground do not take this into account, and thereby further incriminate and induce self-destruction upon those that cannot accept their constant exposure to inevitability.  I came into this world with a choice: the choice to live, or the choice to die. I have taken a long, subjective look at this world and everything it stands for, how it lives, how things work within it, how things are carried out, how we breathe, how we survive, everything about it I have surveyed for as long as I can stand, and I have decided that, though I continue and will continue to stand among the living, I choose death, because death is my fate, death is my perception, death is the only option to those who have felt the bottom as strong as I. Death comes with the sadness of grief that always hits a human with loss. I feel no relief, I feel only the comfort of acknowledgement, that my path is set, that I believe this, however morbid, that life comes to death and that this, like everything, is inevitable. Everything, absolutely everything eventually comes to it, your happiness, your longevity, your well-being, all of these things will be ruined by it. Why not let things slip away when you are already so attuned to it?  Goddamn this world for bringing me so close to the pit, yet leaving me still so far away.    "

This morning things came to a head, and I burned with anger once more.  At the beginning of the year we were told what time to expect our daughter's morning and afternoon buses.  Then, within the last month, the morning and afternoon times have been pushed back further and further.  A couple weeks ago, I had called the transportation office and was told that we should call them if the bus was over ten minutes late from what her pickup/dropoff time was.  That time was, in fact, much later than what we were told at the beginning of the school year.  I was quite understanding when told that the reason Keisha's bus was late was because some parents were either not prepared with their kids to leave in the morning or were not at home when the kids were being dropped off in the afternoon.  No problem, I thought.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  We had even begun accomodating the fact that since our daughter was sometimes late for school, she'd miss having breakfast with the other kids at 9:15.  So we'd started giving her something to eat before her bus came.  Again, no problem.  As long as we know what time we need to have our daughter ready in the morning and what time to expect her when we come home.  This morning I received a call from home.  It was mom.  It was already 9:20 and Keisha's bus had still not come.  Mom had a very important doctor's appointment at 10 AM.  She had called the transportation office and was rebuffed by the 'Customer No-Service Representative'.  So I called.  But, while I was talking, this woman began interrupting me.  I told her to stop doing that, and, finally asked for the name of her supervisor.  She did me one better and proceeded to connect me.    After almost 50 rings, I hung up and searched online for Superintendent Percy Mack's phone number.  The secretary, after hearing my complaint, transferred me to the head of Transportation, a Mr. Sullivan's office.  I voiced my complaint again to his secretary, who then asked for my phone number and promised that she would forward this on to Mr. Sullivan and the transportation person in charge of my daughters bussing.  I then told her that I  expected  a return phone call later today, and we hung up.  Now if I don't hear back after 1 PM, guess who's gonna follow up?         ",

The Oracle allowed Smith to absorb her so that she could help Neo when he confronted Smith in the final battle; she was left behind when Smith was destroyed.  Speaking for yelahneb:  Ben's theory is that Neo has been altered with cyborg-like implants that allow him to connect with the machines.  I'm not satisfied with this interpretation, but I haven't come up with anything more satisfying myself.

Later, of course, my stomach will discourse upon that matter, but as for now, my appetite is only more whetted with each passing bite.  Today is March the second, and outside lurks a cold, dark abyssia, grinning its orai grin on a mass of powerless souls, such a puissant species, with so little power nonetheless. We are devoured by our insolence, have we no idea that this bitter and unending frost is of our creation? Two-hundred years ago, at this very spot, did the frostbitten winter months ever last this long? Nay, this cold is birthed by the womb of industrialization, a sadly necessary function of the new age of man, the man that does not think and has his machines think for him, the man that has forsaken love and home for his love of the world, to the embrace of nothingness, to that which shall never transcend the bonds of time, he gives himself to wasted causes, to countries, he serves the greater good, which is, of course, no good at all, because it is an idea, because society and government are ideas, and as such are powerless to the quaking gods of existence and time, of space and energy, the creations of man are illusion, and we are dust and shadows.  It is a strange fate to have hold of such power and to be so powerless, in the end. What is after death? Judgment? And what, then, happened to your worldly concerns? Is it not, that they vanished in a puff of smoke? Is that not the glory of death, the end of life, the end of the painful and trying realm of mortality?  The darkness of these endless nights with their lopsided, hellish grins are beginning to consume all of us by the night, as during the day the clouds enveloped not only sky but spirit, it saw so many upon the verge of personal destruction, it saw us a glum and powerless race, a mighty fire cut short in a great rain, only the rain took substance, and still the fire died.   And all of this, just a reflection of the morosity I have seen around me, the sorrow self-imposed by the seasons that have left us to be eaten by carrion death and dismay. I watch it and see the sins of the fathers and mothers imposed on their young, simply by the fact that sin is let to exist in the world, and there is no greater pain than watching that which is ourselves to writhe in torments so much greater than ours. The sins take such wonderful guises and times to take us, but they have. Sin, the black blooded vein that flows staight down our family trees and branches into all of us. For this to go on much longer, as I have seen it.  God help us all.     "

For instance, on '24,' all the bad guys used PCs while the good guys all used Macs. The same holds true for 'Austin Powers,' 'Legally Blonde,' etc. Why do you think Apple always gets the plumb roles? I'm of the opinion that Hollywood loves the underdog and has a close relationship with Apple computer, whereas PCs seem controlled by a megalomaniac in Seattle. Are there a lot more Mac zealots like me in Hollywood? Does Apple pour sponsorship money in big-budget studio movies?  Justin Toomey, Athens, Ohio  Ebert:  Since many Windows machines look alike, Apple is one of the few manufacturers that can gain by product placement, which accounts for some of the Macs. It's true that the movie industry and creative types in general prefer the Mac. The novelist Tom Clancy sends e-mails with this signature line: 'Never ask a man what computer he uses. If it's a Mac, he'll tell you. If it's not, why embarrass him?'          ",

As with most things, if you want to get a good idea of an entities reasoning for taking an action, follow the money.  I saw many pieces of infomration back in January and February listing the reasons behind France's, Germany's, and to a lesser extent Russia's opposition to the then proposed military actions against Iraq.  They were the top three countries in oil exploration and refining in Iraq, violating many of the UN sanctions against Iraq.  They knew that any change in the government of Iraq would likely cost them those lucrative contracts, rights, and infrastructure.  So they opposed it.  I'll try to locate the information I saw back then and post it here.  Now they are complaining that we won't let them benefit again on the backs of the Iraqi's.  Additionally, I would bet, but don't know for sure, that the money for this work is coming from the US and maybe the UK.  Why would either country want to give this money to someone else who opposed the action to begin with?  Childish?  Most definitely, but it is reality.  Now, if you can show me some work that a) will not be done in a timely fashion because there are not enough companies to do the work or b) only a company from one of those countries is qualified to do, I will have a problem with it.  Otherwise, you reap what you sow.  As an add on to b), the only thing that I comes to mind right off hand is nuclear material clean up.  France would be good at this since they provide a large percentage of their power through nuclear power, and are pretty good at dealing with the waste.  But, since Iraq does not have a nuclear program, I guess that rules that possibility out.         ",

As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.

The pool party is definately going to have to wait since Zabeth went to Mississippi today, I'm leaving, and, well, Linds is busy. Josh is free though; so is Becky.  I know I'm a worry-bug but can the two of you do something for me in the next month, especially Will. Josh, I know you'll be kind of busy, at least mentally, with Linds and that's great, honestly. Becky is going through a really low period...yes I know euphenism (sp?)but she's told everyone that no one can help, esp Phil and I but I also know she adores her friends. Can you by any chance just keep her busy so she doesn't have that much time to dwell on the problems and spend time with the truly good part of her life, her friends? She loves movie nights and just hanging out. Go the Recreation World, go swimming, go ice skating (she does love that and she's good) just keep reminding her that her friends love her. I would if I was here but I also think that I wouldn't be able to do much even if I was. I love her to death and would give up Phil for her but in her mind the choice has been made and that choice distances Becky from me, at least alittle, for awhile. Also she loves running so if any of you feel up to the challenge go for it. I think she's doing a Red Cross Marathon so.. train with her or something. I love you two!!! Thanks!!! I know exclamation mark crazy but I don't know if I really put how strongly I feel about this in this little post (yes, LITTLE). I never thought I would stab a friend like I have, in fact I never thought I would have to face anything like it. You two have seen the brainstorming of if I do like him and if not and if I would ever act on it. You've heard me mull over how Becca has felt over the months and you have seen me deal with it. I also know that you two love me and have put up with alot because of me. Thank You. I know that isn't much but honestly thank you. I don't know what's going to happen as much as I wish I could say but I do know this, friends are the world.

I know Josh by now is rolling his eyes and going 'Rosie, you know I would without you asking' but I have to. I have to know that she'll be ok; not only that but happy. I want it so badly right now. Take care of her for me, for everyone. She's such an angel. No matter how much she says she's stubborn, strong, ok, fine, and going to be fine, she truly is more fragile than all that. Thanks.

But doing requires, well, DOING something!  Many times there's a gap between knowing and doing.  Yet, once you close the gap and unite knowing and doing, sparks really fly!  Do I hear bells?  Repeat after me: 'I affirm the special bond and unique relationship that exists between knowing and doing and promise to keep it alive always.' (Sniffle!)  Here's some advice:   Details.   Planning is essential for converting ideas into action.  But don't get hung up on details, wasting precious time and resources debating specifics of strategy and implementation.  View plans like blueprints -- where you focus on essentials and leave room for adjustments.  Embrace technology.   Technology produces new tools for getting things done in a changing world.  Seek every opportunity at work and at home to learn and use these tools.  Risky business.   Fear of failing may prevent you from doing a lot of things, yet knowing comes from doing.  Be more willing to tackle risk in your life.  You'll never know until you try! I now pronounce you... umm... more effective!    ",

It is a mind-bending experience. You can actually sit in front of a monitor and watch a sample of everything that everyone in the world is searching for. (Hint: sex, God, jobs and, oh my word, professional wrestling usually top the lists.)... In the past three years, Google has gone from processing 100 million searches per day to over 200 million searches per day. And get this: only one-third come from inside the U.S. The rest are in 88 other languages...'  'Search engines are constantly adding and removing pages, as well as altering the algorithms they use to rank pages. However, there's a great obsession with Google because of the large amounts of traffic it can deliver. Of the four most popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo, AOL and MSN SearchGoogle's results are used at the first three...'  'Google's continued success depends on its ability to collect unaffected Web content, which means that it must avoid the single individual's assertion of meaning. This strategy implies that any metadata scheme for the Web that promotes the meaning assertion of a single Web author (i.e., My Web page means this) will be avoided by aggregators. The strategy of aggregation, the enlistment of Web authors as lay indexers, and the temptation of bad faith points to the importance of maintaining the ignorance of lay indexers.'         ",

      "1": "            All batteries eventually die. The iPod battery is quite replaceable; various vendors are available online. You can do it yourself, or Apple can do it for you. Battery life, of course, depends on individual use. Owners of the original generation of iPods are doing fine on the boards.   i just got off the phone with a representative at Apple.  here's the story: up until literally a  week  ago (!), anyone whose internal iPod battery died had to pay (at the very least)  $250.00  to have the unit serviced, regardless of what was wrong with it; which, of course, is almost as much as buying a new one (they run about 3, 4 and 5 hundred dollars each, depending on the GB).  as you might have guessed, consumers weren't too happy with the cost, so Apple finally relented (as i said, just about 7 days ago), and began offering a 'battery exchange program' for those whose iPod batteries died.  the cost of this service is  $99.00, plus shipping and handling .  to have your battery replaced, you are required to  mail your iPod back to the company , and they may send a replacement unit back instead of your original, depending on their workload.  the nationwide Apple stores cannot replace your battery, and according to the company, neither can the owner; the internal battery is  not  being offered for individual sale by Apple.  a second option is to purchase Apple's 'iPod Protection Plan' for  $59.00 .  this will cover battery replacement for up to 2 years, but you must still send the iPod back to Apple for the same aforementioned service.  after the 2 years of the plan are up, you're back to the $99.00 charge for battery replacement.   despite the company's assertions to the contrary, however, there  is  a non-Apple site that you can buy a replacement iPod internal battery from:   iPodbattery.com , for about $50 apiece.  they even include online instructions on how to install it, for the   old  and   new  models.   average life span of the iPod's internal battery, according to Apple:  1 year with heavy use, 2 years with light use.    it's a brilliant marketing scheme; charge the consumer 3 to 5 hundred dollars for your initial product, and then another hundred bucks every 1-2 years after to keep it running.    i gotta admire them for their chutzpah at the very least, especially with the competition undercutting them by about 50 bucks.  perhaps they figure that the average consumer either won't know any better, or will be unwilling to install the battery themselves...?

Josh ascended the stairs after reading The Blog, a site dedicated primarily to the vastly interwoven lives and troubles of a few students at BHS, an oppressed sort who really couldn't give a shit less what anyone thought of their methods. So it was that they started a BLog with Lindsey Reid as its leader, and therein their worldly and strange issues came to life upon the Internet for the world to see.  Weeks passed, the BLog was filled with odd topics: a strange tale of the boy Josh and a girl named Leigh Anne, the endless mental struggle of one of the sites lesser contributers, Rosie, and the endless wisdoms of the entity known as Will, who responded without fail where needed.  But it came to be one day that Lindsey was scheduled for a cruise, and through some twist of fate, she met Mitch.  Mitch was a confusing boy. At first, it was thought that he was a nicer sort, a calm variety, charming and appealing, but time has a strange way of breaking these confines and showing people for reality. It was that Mitch's ambition and stupidity bled through and together one day, and he began hitting on Lindsey, much to her and the rest of the Bloggers' knowledges, without much subtlety. As his forwardness wore on, the BLog was posed with an interesting question: who the HELL is this guy?  The question in Josh's mind, however, was 'what is grind dancing?'. He ascended those stairs to his sister's room, his sister, the dancer of years. Surely, she would know this strange sort of dancing.  'Hey Kate,' said Josh, opening the door and looking to his sister, who was busily working on a project and talking on the phone simultaneously. 'Hey,' she said, turning her attention to the slightly-longer-than-it-should-be haired boy. It was an assorted rarity that he would ever bother her sister, and the abberation from the norm was actually welcomed in a nearly invariable life.  'Umm, got a question, I thought you would know,' 'Shoot,' ''Kay, what is grind...dancing?' Her eyebrows suddenly shot up and she stuttered a bit, laughing nervously, as if stopping herself from blurting some awful truth. Josh suddenly felt embarrased and said, 'Oh...it's ' bad ' stuff isn't it?' 'Haha,' she started with an orai smile, 'it  is ,'  It came to pass that Josh became extremely wary of the Mitch person, instantly went out and bought Lindsey an easily concealable shotgun, which he loaded with  SLUGS , because he wanted to make ready-sure that if the Mitch kid were to put his 'grind' moves on (and for those who haven't put the pieces together yet, take the name of the dance and apply it to two human bodies) that Lindsey would be well-equipped to deal with the perverted youngster with due finality. Though all applauded the boy's forwardness and utter 'balls', they also jeered it, and laughed at him ever after, until they all had hemmorages and died.  Summary: I ask my sister what grind dancing is, she flips out because it's a 'bad' dance, as in morally wrong. Uhoh. I thought he was an idiot, now not only to I know, but I can also tack on the adjective 'horny' to that 'idiot'.   O ye gods, what shall you do? :) Hope you're having TONS of fun with this situation.      "

Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was   www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the   Mis-Lead .         ",

Yeh right, 4:45 on a Wednesday afternoon and the server is too busy.   So, my school service club is selling these Cystic Fybrosis things and I was wondering if any of you would like to buy one. You don't really get anything in return, you just get to give me money.  The upside is that they are only a buck, which isn't too bad.  If I sell 5, then I get to attend a pizza party, which isn't really that great because it will be Papa John's and I don't like their pizza.  So, actually, this is a really depressing way to sell something.  I don't get anything, you don't get anything...yup.  So, give me your money now that I've motivated you.

Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.

They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.

      "1": "           I enjoyed Buffy's solution, and a few of the exchanges.  Beyond that:  One of the ubervamps nearly killed Buffy; now Andrew, Anya, Wood, Giles, and Xander can take out a few.  Angel arrived to deliver an amulet that did...what, exactly?  Talk about easy fixes.  Good thing Angel set up that second line of defense...where, exactly?  If it was daylight, couldn't they have knocked down the walls so the ubervamps couldn't get out of the hole?  Easy fix, part 2: the scythe.  Please.  Never mentioned before, never fully explained, and looked like a prop for some Klingon blood feud.  And let's introduce Buffy's greatest threat towards the end of the season, with no backstory, no explanation -- she just needs something to hit.  And let's invent a Big Bad that can be any dead person, and *not* have it appear as Tara at any time, or, in the last moment, appear as her mother -- wouldn't *that* have been more morale-defeating?  And throughout the enTIRE series it has been proven that crosses repel vampires, yet not *one* person brings a cross into the *Hellmouth*.  As for Kennedy and Willow, the writers assumed I would care, without making any effort to sell it.  And finally, Spike, who the writers have worked *very* hard to sell to me, sacrifices himself not in a personal, character-driven way, but by wearing an unexplained amulet that robs him of choice -- he never knew what it did, or the consequences, until the last moment, so instead of making a journey from A to B, he suddenly finds himself at B, and figures, what the hell, might as well.  That's not sacrifice, that's circumstance.  I *much* preferred Anya's sudden death in battle.  A senseless death should be a senseless death, not a slapped-together oh-lookout-I-guess-I'm-sacrificing-myself-oh-well death.  Either write a character-driven sacrifice based on clear, high-stakes choice, or let the character simply die in battle.  Meanwhile -- I enjoyed the funny moments, I enjoyed Angel's initial appearance (though he disappeared as yet another casualty in the writer-painted-in-a-corner situation), and I *thoroughly* enjoyed Buffy's solution, though I question the wisdom of ending the series with such a world-changing event -- who is going to teach all these girls?  I predict that, being human, the majority will turn out to be chaotic and dangerous.  But of course, we know they won't, because we all know that if women were given such power, surely they wouldn't do the baaaad things men do, because women are inherently *good* creatures!  Take that, evil evil men!  I am sorely disappointed that the story, which was so effective at creating a metaphor and myth for personal empowerment, ended on such a simplistic, heavy-handed note.  The show remains as important to me as Twin Peaks or B5.  I will enjoy it for many years.  But beyond season 5, it was notable only for select episodes or isolated moments.  To its credit, those select episodes and isolated moments were better than most of the television out there at the time, and that's a high compliment indeed.  Sometime, watch the whole arc of season 3 with the mayor, or season 5 with Glory.  Then watch season 7, and note how it skips and sputters to the end.  It could have been, should have been, so much more.         ",

      "0": "              JENNIE   Jennie has been feeling really depressed.  I guess you could say that she's been that way for quite some time.  Other emotions: anger, resentment, frustration.  I've felt these same feelings and have often shared them here.  Yesterday morning she came home from work in time to head back out to an appointment.  I later saw her when she came into the restaurant where I work.  By the time I arrived home (circa 4:15 PM), she hadn't gone to bed yet.  She had a lot on her mind, and I let her talk.  Then I got a little scared when she said she was having suicidal thoughts.  Whereas I use self-injury to cope, she uses food, namely sugar.  I'd been urging her to call the Crisis Care hotline so that she could speak with someone, and even get help for her depression, etc.  Finally, I called the number and handed the phone to her.  She talked with a woman on the phone for some time.  This woman asked if she wanted to go to their office last night; Jennie said she was feeling like she'd be okay just to go in tomorrow (this morning).  So she made an appointment for 10 AM.  I remember, two years ago, when my mom first moved up here, that my mom wound up in the hospital for a week.  I really hope that isn't necessary for Jennie, although I have to consider the possibility.  I feel sad and a little worried for my wife.  She is the love of my life, and I want her to feel better.  I've seen her pull back from God so much over these past couple of years.  I've encouraged her to draw near to him, thinking that, maybe he's allowing all the things that are going on to happen so that she will turn back to him.  'What if God is allowing all this to happen to humble you?' I inquired gently.  She has expressed that she feels it's useless to pray.  It's as though doing all the spiritual things like praying, studying the Bible, meeting with others, are not working.  I know I've felt that way at times myself.  I told her that I was committed to being there for her no matter what.  When we got married, I sang Steven Curtis Chapman's song 'I Will Be Here' to her as part of my wedding vows.  I told her that I Will Be Here no matter what happens.  I need to be careful of using pat phrases like that, however.  Because they can and have been overused, in time they seem to lose their meaning.  It's a little bit like singing the same songs again and again at church; after awhile we get so used to the words that we stop meditating on their meaning.    KEISHA   Keisha has also had a tough week.  Her school is conducting Terra Nova testing, which is supposed to give an idea of how kids might perform on future standardized tests.  I guess it also may indicate where the school can improve in their instruction, etc.  She loves to read, which fires Jennie and I up to no end.  It's becoming so common for her to pick up a picture book we get from the library and read it out loud to us.  Some of the multi-syllable words I help her sound out.  Then after she's read it to me, I sometimes review it with her to verify she understood what the story was about.  I love going to the library to pick out books for her.  Because I want reading to be fun and the time we read together to be fun, I've opted for Humor books.  Our library places a humor sticker on those books deemed as such, which makes them easy to spot.  Keisha also loves to draw.  It's evident in that her default activity is to grab some paper and some crayons, markers, etc. and start drawing.  But math appears to be a bit more difficult.  Perhaps it's because it can be rather abstract to see numbers on a page and not be able to instinctively see their meanings.  I try to think back to when I was learning addition and subtraction and how I was.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember.  She also gets easily frustrated when she's not picking the information up.  I'm challenged by this because I can be the same way.  I also have to be careful not to get impatient with her and be sure to encourage her.  There were some particular problems she had for homework that were bothering her.  I finally had the idea to use pennies out of her bank as visual aids.  That seemed to help.  What helped even more, according to Keisha, was that I was there to help her.  I'm not a psychiatrist and I know I'm not qualified to diagnose my daughter, but, as someone with ADHD, I can say that I see some signs of it with her.  As I would talk with her about her homework, she would play with her pencil and eraser - distracted.  I found that frustrating because I felt that she wasn't paying attention to me.   ME   I'm learning to take advantage of my day planner.  I look forward to using colors, etc. to make appointments, etc. stand out.  (I realize that this might sound a bit strange to you all.)  If I can make my organization system fun, colorful, and interesting, then I think I'll have a good chance of keeping up with it.  I would love to have a coach; someone to help keep me on track, etc.  I'm learning to use timers: for example, the kitchen timer has gone off four times since I began this post to remind me that I need to leave for work.  My watch alarm has a 'snooze button' effect in which it sounds five minutes after I touch the particular button.  I use that to remind me that I need to take my medicine and when I need to get ready to leave work, among other things.  I'm using other alarm clocks, too.  I hope that eventually stuff like this will become second nature to me and help me be more effective.  There is so much more that I could probably talk about - I need to talk about - but I need to go for now.  (like we found out yesterday that our Transitional Medicaid expires at the end of this month for Jennie and I.  This means we'll have no insurance. Ugh!)  Pray for us.         ",

      "3": "           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         ",

First, the easy ones  Miriam - rest, drink fluids, and don't read Salon (Oh, sorry, that would make  me  feel better) Chris - Good luck with the interview.  Let us know how it went.  Also, congrats on the birth of your niece.  Ok, here is a very simplistic solution.  Develop real, practical, cheap, alternative energy sources.  Face it, why did we originally get involved in the Middle East?  To protect our oil interests from the Soviets.  Now we are there and can't or won't back out and let the people solve there own problems, in part, because we are dependent on the bubbling crude.  If you develop a hydrogen car (very easy in theory, tough in execution because of no infrastructure to deliver the H2), our oild demands would drop.  I would think that you could also use that technology to heat homes (reducing the need for fuel oil).  It would probably lower our nationwide demand for oil to the point that we could provide our own national requirements, or get it from non-OPEC countries.  Imagine what that would do for air quality.  If that happens, why would we stay in areas that we are not wanted and that don't serve our national interests.  That would allow us to pull out of Saudi Arabia, supposedly making the Islamic extremists happy (I'll believe that when I see it), since we would no longer be on Holy ground.  BTW, the last I knew, Prince Sultan airbase is out in the middle of the desert, not surrounding Mecca or Medina, but hey, what do I know, I'm just a Christian infidel.  Now, to reality.  Johnathan, in this case, I don't think we can negotiate on one side and use military force on the other.  Concerning Israel, we have limited military presence in Israel, probably just in the form of observers and exchange officers.  We (the US) became a target because of our support for Israel.  The option of abandoning Isreal and letting things go as the two sides want, would, to me, give the message that we will let the Arabs finish the job Hitler started.  I know that is not what you are proposing, but that is how *I* see a change in our stance playing out.  As for giving the Palestinians there own country, that sounds good in theory.  But, will Arafat or whoever is the leader use all his resources to prevent Palestine from becoming the launching point and safe haven for organizations like Hamaas and Islamic Jihad in their effort to destroy Israel?  His track record is not great so far, thus Isreal's stance on the issue, and I don't see where we can tell Isreal that they have to give up territory to an enemy that is sworn to destroy them.  Concerning Saudi Arabia, at this point, we don't have any choice but to have troops there.  Prince Sultan is an established base that is currently critical to the implending conflict.  The ironic thing is that the base was closed and our troops were removed after the Gulf War.  Then, circa 1995, the base was reopened.  You know why?  Because Iraq was proving to be less than compliant with UN requirements.  So, if Iraq becomes democratic, or, as tangentially suggested by my esteemed colleague from the great region of NOVA, the 51st state, we won't need to have troops on what is considered by some to be holy ground.  Either because they won't be needed at all or because they will be able to operate from Iraq.  In summary, I don't think we can negotiate and retaliate in this case.  Imperialist America.  I am pretty much a Hawk, but that idea does not sit well with me.  If we ever are going to have a world wide government, it must be done through peaceful means if it is to last.  Military conquest will not work, because enough people will feel oppressed to overthrow the imperialist aggressors.  Lovely Angie, you mean that there is more to America the Mickey D's and Swoosh shoes?  Man, I have been living in cave.  Seriously though, could you or Chris explain the basis of the 'arrogant conservative President' comment.  There are lots of adjectives I would agree with when describing President Bush, but arrogant is not one of them.  He expects our allies to either support us (Britain and many other European countries) or get out of the way (Canada), but definitely not stand in the wat (France-Germany).  Given all that the US has done for the world and Europe specifically in the last century (led the Allies in defeating Hitler, defeated the Soviet Union without firing a shot), I think we are entitled to at least expect the main benefactors of the US to not get in our way.  I don't care if they choose to not get involved for internal political or other reasons.  Just step aside.  I don't see that as arrogant.  Chris, there are many people around the world and quite a few in the US who don't believe that capitalism will help the raise the qulity of life in the world.  Many people still dream of socialist or communist states.  Enough rambling for now.  Lunch was supposed to be over half an hour ago.           ",

I think it'd be really funny to see any one of yall try to get into that unit- CRISIS would laugh their asses off.  Trust me, yall are nowhere near depressed, I promise- and you really shouldn't want to be.  I wouldn't wish all this on my worst enemy.  It's pain like yall will never have to go through- it's not something to take lightly.  I laugh every time one of you goes 'I'm so depressed today,' as if you know the meaning of the word.  You really don't, and fortunately for you, you probably never will.  At least I hope you won't.    But seriously, yall- come on.  The unit is no picnic- you've never been any place like it and never want to be.  This isn't some stunt for attention or whatever, and should never be used as one.  This is real- I don't think some of you get that- this is REAL.  These are our LIVES we are talking about here.  This isn't something that is going to go away. We can't just snaap our fingers and make it better- the hospital does not by any means, fix things.  We didn't just wake up one morning and say, 'hey, I think I'll be depressed and go to the hospital to get it fixed.'  It just doesn't work like that.  This isn't some broken bone that the doctors can just magically heal.  This is something that we might actually not get over.  I hope to God that we will because I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.  Point is, there is no guarantee that everything is going to be all hunky dory.  This is something that takes work- it's harder than anything I've ever had to do in my entire life.  We didn't come out of the hospital with all of our problems fixed, as some of you seem to think.  We're not 'back to normal.'  This is one of those things that changes your life, for better or for worse, but it has happened and we have to deal with that.  I'm not saying yall don't have problems- you do- but their not things that make you 'depressed'.  Just because you are sad or disappointed for a couple of days does not make you depressed.  Depression is something we will never be able to explain to you because you haven't been there.    I'm sorry if that makes you feel left out or on the outside or whatever.  We're the ones on the outside here, and I promise you don't want to and probably can't join us.  We appreciate your friendship and support, but we can't make you a big part of this, even if we wanted to.  There are some things that truly are beyond comprehension.  I really think this is the problem here- all of a sudden, we're in a whole different world from yall, and it's impossible for yall to join us here, try as you might.  You can't make yourself depressed, and even if you could, I wouldn't suggest it.  Even if we were to miraculously get better right now, we still wouldn't be able to rejoin your world, if for no other reason than we have experienced the other world.  Really, I am sorry that we've left yall in this position, but it's not something we would have ever chosen for ourselves.  But it has been chosen for us.  Unfortunately, we can no longer lean on yall as much as we used to, by choice or not, so we're having to make up for it by leaning on each other.  Yall are still our best friends, but you just have to understand- you can't always be there.  And Josh, I loved the British spelling.  Nice touch.    "

Some other people (friends?) and I were being chased through a multi-story building with a parking lot by a psychopath.  It also took place at a park nearby.  The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama.  As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy.  Below are some things that I can remember, though:  - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work.  He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor.  We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between.  I remember something like this being done in the movie '  Being John Malchovich '. - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor.  We had somehow thought that it was a 'safe haven' - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM.  By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.         ",

So, as I'm sure you can tell, today sucked.  Yes, I have been busy, but if I might ask, why hasn't anyone called?  No one ever calls me, I have to do all the calling.  I'd really appreciate a phone call every now and then.  Not too much to ask for the girl whose mental state is even more questionable than it was to begin with, is it?  Sorry if I'm antagonistic or just plain rude, but I've had the worst day I've had in a long time.  And I knew about Linds's mom.  Linds called me from the hospital that day.  I also talked to her mom the other day and she sounded good and she said she felt better, so kudos to Mrs. Reid!  Thanks for being concerned and everything.  Please, someone, e-mail or call me.  I'm actually begging here...and if I may ask, what's the deal with the Greek thing?  I didn't go very far back before I wrote this.  Anyway, see ya.  ~Z       "

      "1": "              Report: SUVs pose danger to cars   Congressional hearing focuses on safety   Wednesday, February 26, 2003 Posted: 1:06 PM EST (1806 GMT)    WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Congress takes its closest look at auto safety on Wednesday since the Firestone tire debacle nearly two years ago, probing the safety of sport utility vehicles.   Regulators, auto makers and consumer groups were scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rollover risks, seat belt use and other safety concerns associated with one of the most popular vehicles ever.   The spotlight will be on the nation's top auto safety regulator, Jeffrey Runge, who last month stunned the industry by criticizing SUV safety. The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for meaningful and swift changes.    Concerned about deaths   Runge, an emergency room physician who will be the featured witness at the hearing, is most concerned about rollover deaths and injuries in sport utility vehicles, seat belt use, and the threat posed to smaller cars by bigger and stronger SUVs.   'SUVs inflict more harm on occupants than other cars do,' said Brian O'Neill, president of an insurance industry group that will release new statistics on SUV safety at the hearing.   The group's report, an analysis of government safety data, will show that sport utility fatality rates have fallen sharply in recent years and are now almost even with passenger cars.   But O'Neill said the analysis will also show that because of their size and weight, sport utility vehicles can cause considerable damage to smaller passenger cars in side-impact crashes.    Making their case   The auto industry aggressively defended SUV safety at a news conference on Tuesday, and plans to do the same before Senate lawmakers.   'SUVs are very safe vehicles,' said Sue Cischke, vice president of safety at Ford Motor Co. She said sport utility vehicles are under attack for some of their most noteworthy attributes.   'They do well in front crashes, side crashes and rear crashes,' Cischke said. 'Unfortunately, many people who are killed (especially in rollovers) many times are not wearing safety belts.'    Acknowledging concerns    But the industry has recently acknowledged SUV safety concerns that critics have complained about for years, and federal regulators and Congress have sharpened their focus on them.   The industry's chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, has released data that auto companies agree with government figures showing the fatality rate in rollovers is three times greater for those in SUVs than for those in cars.   Auto makers have also promised to work together to reduce fatalities and injuries resulting from weight and size differences of SUVs and passenger cars. Some longer term improvements could involve design changes in one or both classes of vehicles.   The car companies are trying to head off regulation, which Runge threatened to pursue if the industry did not act voluntarily.   But some critics complain the industry is ceding a little ground now to ease pressure for new regulation and that voluntary design changes could take several years. It can take the government four years or more to approve new regulation.    Some Call For Fast Action   Joan Claybrook, a former director of the federal auto safety agency and now president of consumer group Public Citizen, says Congress should immediately mandate new rules.   'The industry has known for years about these dangers and has bobbed and weaved to avoid regulation,' Claybrook said. 'The government has also dropped the ball.'   Claybrook was also a fierce critic of industry and government action during the Firestone tire saga in which millions of tires were recalled in 2000 and 2001 after tread separations and blowouts were linked to more than 270 deaths. Most of those tires were standard equipment on Ford Explorer SUVs.   Congress passed landmark auto safety legislation after that investigation.            ",

Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.

    "query_text": "             Last Tuesday the car broke down.  Maxine, the name Mom gave her 1983 Datsun Nissan Maxima and gave to us when she moved back to Texas last year, finally died.  I've written here in the past about the problems we'd been having with the car.  I'm reminded of a friend's comment that the least expensive car is the one you already own.  I'm also reminded of the scene near the climax of   'The Blues Brothers'  movie when their car falls apart outside the downtown tax assessor's office.  ( ASIDE:  Among the many   memorable quotes from the movie  is this one from Elwood Blues -- 'Our Lady of Blessed Acceleration, don't fail us now!')  Both Jennie and I knew that it was just a matter of time until the car broke down.  I had hoped and prayed that it would happen mercifully.  Last Tuesday, June 22nd, I drove Maxine to work.  I made a turn and must have hit a 'chuck-hole' (aka 'pot hole') in the road because when I got to the parking lot, I had some trouble steering the car into the parking spot.  After my shift I returned to the car to inspect whatever damage there was.  I saw that the front, driver's-side corner of the bumper had been bent to rub against the tire.  I got on the ground and bent the bumper away from the wheel.  Satisfied with that, I got in the car and started her up.  I put the car in gear and went forward (I had pulled into the parking spot in reverse earlier).  I went a few inches and felt the car fall forward.  I shut the engine off and went to inspect.  The front, driver's-side wheel had come off the axle!  That corner of the car was being supported by the wheel.  At once I felt grateful to God that it happened in a parking lot instead of on the street or worse, a highway.  I'm also glad that no one was hurt.  I returned to work, called Jennie, and walked home.  A half hour later, I walked back to the car, with two empty backpacks and a shoulder bag.  I got everything I wanted out of the car.  So it has sat for the past week at that same spot in the parking lot.  Since it's a high-traffic area (drive-thru, etc.), a number of people have asked about it.  Some have offered to tow it (that business card on the dashboard); others have offered to buy it or fix it.  Maxine is beyond repair.  I almost feel like I'd have to pay someone else to take her off our hands (lol)!  Yet if there is someone who wants to give us some money for her, then Amen!  Something else that's interesting... At the beginning of the month we had gotten 30-day temporary tags and some insurance for the car.  We knew that it didn't have a chance in h*** of passing the emissions inspection.  We had discovered that the only way to get out of an insurance policy is if the car would break down.  So, in general, we can see how God is blessing us.  Our lives are more complicated (Jennie works 3rd shift, for example) by not having a car, but we're managing, for the meantime.         ",

If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.         ",

The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.

We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).

Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.

What's the lowdown? --Jerry M., Los Angeles     Dear Jerry:   History records no observation of Christmas before 354, and by that time there was no one around who remembered exactly when Jesus was born. Today, historians have all but given up trying to figure it out. They give his birth date as 6-8 BC (good trick, but this was no ordinary dude) and leave it at that.  Nobody knows exactly why Christ's birthday is celebrated on December 25. One theory holds that this is the right date, postulating that Zachary was high priest and that the Day of Atonement fell on September 24, ergo, John the Baptist was born on June 24 and Christ dropped in exactly six months later on December 25. Modern scholars use this theory to get laughs at cocktail parties.   Another guess works backward from the supposed date of the crucifixion (March 25), figuring that Christ was conceived exactly 33 years before he died, True Believers having no use for fractional numbers. According to the most tenable hypothesis, Christ's birthday was assigned to the winter solstice (December 25 in the Julian calendar, January 6 in the Egyptian) because the date had a ready-made pagan holiday, the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' (or 'ancient Saturnalia debauch,' as you put it).  The idea that Jesus was a Pisces probably comes from the characterization of that sign as one of spiritualism, humility, compassion, sacrifice, etc. Students of astrology will tell you it's not kosher to work the formula backwards that way.

    "query_text": "           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         ",

We have and continue to enjoy the after effects of the initial Apollo missions with the spin off technologies.  I don't see that we will have the same boost as we got in the 60's from this, but that is the great thing about technology - you don't know about something useful until someone invents it.  '...the fact that over 9 million Americans (including myself) are unemployed...' - What exactly makes someone unemployed?  Is my wife unemployed?  She has no paying job but also does not want one right now.  Is she included in those statistics?  What about the artist/actor who does not have a job because they are busy trying to get a part or find a patron?  They could at least respond to any of the fast food restaurants that always have 'Now Hiring' signs out front.  Are they included?  9 out of roughly 250 is 4%, which I think is lower than the rates I had heard (~6%), so it makes my wonder even more as to exactly how they come up with the numbers.  It just proves the saying that there are three types of information - lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Note that I am not saying that we don't have too much unemployment.  I would love for there to be 0%, but short of the government hiring anyone without a job to do something, I don't think the government has the responsibility or even power to do anything about it.  '...our economy has continuously gone downhill ...' - The economic downturn/recession/depression/dip/or whatever the hell you want to call it began noticeably in March of 2000 when the stock market went through its 'correction' (I hate that term, but that's what they call it).  The NASDAQ went from 5000 to 2000 in something like 6 weeks and the NYSE had a similar drop, taking down many peoples retirement and college education savings with it.  A friend of mine stupidly was holding the money he had made from the sale of his house in NASDAQ and watched it get reduced to about 1/4 of the original amount.  Let's see, I believe that in March of 2000, Governor Bush was trying to secure the Republican nomination for the White House.  And let's see, yeah I can see where President Bush was directly responsible for allowing the terrorist attacks that lead to the deaths of ~3,300 people, shaking our country to it's core, and causing an already weak economy to weaken further.  But the really bad news for the argument is that the economy has grown for the last two quarters and the highest rates in 20 years.  '...Bush stole the presidency...' - Sigh.  Miriam, help me out here.  How many times have I addressed this one in the last 3 years?  20?  I know that Eva was not here for them, so I will state my response again.  There are laws in place in every state that govern the way public elections are to be held.  They were followed in Florida, but Al Gore wanted to change them so that the ballots would be counted again (making three times if I remember correctly).  Bush appealed to the State Supreme Court, which upheld the decision to go ahead and recount.  Bush then appealed to the US Supreme Court, who finally voted 5-4 to stop the recounts and declare a winner based on the votes counted.  The Democrats cried foul and this was partisan politics.  If it had truly been partisan, the vote would have been 7-2, as that is the breakdown of R vs. D appointees.  What that showed to me was that the court was deeply divided, but made a ruling and it was carried out without the violence that probably would have occurred in other countries.  The Democrats keep bringing up the 500,000 more votes that Gore received.  If our system of elections was based on straight count, then that would be a valid point.  But, since the US Constitution clearly spells out the Electoral College process, it does not matter.  What the Democrats should be doing is trying to shore up support in the states where they were close, transferring the popular vote to electoral votes and possibly a White House win (shudder).  As a side note, one or two of the Florida newspapers went back after the fact and counted the ballots.  There was a slight change in the numbers, but Bush still won the state by some ridiculously close margin (around 200 votes).  '...(1)poorly thought out, and (2)expensive, (3)publicity stunt.' - (1) I don't think it is poorly thought out.  All that he has done is to set a target.  Was Kennedy's proclamation poorly thought out in 1961?  (2) Yes it will be  (3)  Probably so.  But then again, anytime a President announces something, it can probably be considered a publicity stunt or at the very least politically motivated (see the recent immigration announcement)  'He's just cutting funding and jobs from other NASA programs. '  - Would you rather he keep funding them and come up with the money from, say, Medicare?  Will any of those people, say working on the Space Shuttle, be able to transfer to the new programs?  I would hope so.  I found out with some dismay this weekend that Sean O'Keefe (NASA administrator) announced that the next HST maintenance mission has been scrubbed.  The current gyros have a 50% chance of failing in the next year and 75% within the next two years.  Once they go, Hubble will not be usable.  Additionally, the mission was going to boost it into a higher orbit.  Without this, it sounds like Hubble will reenter the atmosphere sometime in the next 2-4 years.  The replacement telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2008-2011.   Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.         ",

Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.

It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.         ",

Not only is my dad being bastardly, *takes deep breath to prepare for spilling guts and also preparing (hopefully) for sympathy* my cousin Gael just found out that she has cancer.  Badly.  I mean, monster.  She's smoked for a while but it started as skin cancer, we think, and spread.  Technically it's called 'carcinoma without principle cause.'  Which means that it's cancer that the doctors don't know how she contracted.  And she's taking chemo.   And I didn't know until TODAY.  And I'll give you two guesses as to which parent told me.  Yeah.  On the way back from lunch, my dad tells me in this fucking patronizing voice and makes me cry, making my mascara go EVERYWHERE.  And it just sucked, so when I got home, I practically jumped out of his car with barely a goodbye and ran into the house, where I just broke down.  I WON'T BREAK DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM.  NEVER AGAIN.  So, as I'm sure you can tell, today sucked.  Yes, I have been busy, but if I might ask, why hasn't anyone called?  No one ever calls me, I have to do all the calling.  I'd really appreciate a phone call every now and then.  Not too much to ask for the girl whose mental state is even more questionable than it was to begin with, is it?  Sorry if I'm antagonistic or just plain rude, but I've had the worst day I've had in a long time.  And I knew about Linds's mom.  Linds called me from the hospital that day.  I also talked to her mom the other day and she sounded good and she said she felt better, so kudos to Mrs. Reid!  Thanks for being concerned and everything.  Please, someone, e-mail or call me.

Here this morning they build us up by telling us we're going to see the play during school; that got shot down as the announcements came on, telling us  au contraire  straight off.

Sans de school is always nice, but if we have to put up with it, it's no big deal, considering this is the home stretch before spring break. And that will be  wonderful . And it will also be  one-thousand years . Massive crying on my part.  Still didn't go shopping. Surprise! Why would I? I had a ton to do this week. Going to my dad's isn't typically a great feat, however, and considering this was the last week I'll have the chance for the next three weeks or so, his house had to take the perogative. Although we locked horns this weekend over pointless matters, of which I came out the better, I'm afraid. It feels pretty lame winning a fight that nets you nothing, so I've found.  But it was a great weekend, and a great week. I didn't go to school Wednesday, I stayed the night at my mom's Friday and ended up waking in a stupor, I went to my dad's and basically ran around outside for the balance of the weekend, I kicked  ASS  at Unreal Tournament 2003. And then last night I wanted to crush some cans outside, just to have something to do, and the resident rug mounkeys, also known as my neighbors under the age of twelve who talk of adult matters (for instance, the words 'sex' or 'condom') with guarded words and sly grins, came over and helped out, whereafter they tried wrestling me to the ground and I  defeated  them utterly. It was a rout and a half. It was also yesterday that I listened to a CD in its entirety without stopping once. Even as the phone rang, and knowing it was for my sister, I left the room and closed the door, handled the call as fast as I possibly could, jumped back into the room and sprang onto my place on the bed, the side I never sit on, where I have found the wind blows the most. Tapping my foot to such songs as  Ten Miles High ,  Full Colour Is The Night ,  Nighttime Birds ,  The Millenium King ,  Shadegrown , yes, all those satanistic, wonderful and enlightening bands.   And today, going to a movie avec Lily and Zoe, the latter of whom I have never met, so woohoo! It actually doesn't bother me as to what we see, it's just nice to get out and do something. Ok, so it blows my allowance to hell, so no AudBLogging or CDs for me, but I suppose this is what my allowance was supposed to go towards anyway. In case Lily is reading this:   AFTER   2:30, or I won't get the call / I'll get screwed over by my teachers, and  that  won't happen since I put it on 'Silent'. So worst case is I miss it by three seconds and call you back thereafter. Talk to you then.  Thou art blind, be the law art thou as pride.    "

It would be easier to choose an album, like Blondie's Parallel Lines, maybe.  That sounds more pop than, say, Costello's This Year's Model.  But to be honest, the stuff from that time period is really before my time -- I experienced more through childhood osmosis than conscious choice.  If I had to choose something from my own nascent maturity, it would be something from 79-82, after New Wave changed slightly.  From there, I'd choose Gary Numan's 'Cars' or perhaps Berlin's 'The Metro.'  Both of those lean more towards synth pop than Parallel Lines, but it's when I started to become aware of pop music, so it's a sound that has a stronger emotional appeal.         ",

      "1": "           MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'     -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          ",

      "2": "           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named 'Donnie Darko' several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes. Nothing done to them'          ",

      "4": "       I suppose. I don't take her for much of an overestimater, though. A tad bit of a dreamer, but that wasn't e'er a crime, so far as in my book.  Hmm. Well, what's been going on lately. I'm in a really EMO mood, so I should probably make a long post and tell you all to ignore it (but that actually means, read it thuroughly and tell other people that I'm depressed, too). Actually no, take it as you will; it's sort of like writing lyrics in the BLog, it doesn't change anything, but it gives a certain sense of...something. I really can't remember since I haven't posted any in quite a while. I might put down one of my newer works for the public perusal...it hasn't been recorded yet, but it'll pretty much tell you where I'm coming from.  Hm, well. So yesterday I sat on the phone with my dad talking about how apathetic I've become to everything, how nothing really seems to be doing it anymore. I started out the whole call by saying, 'I wasn't asleep, just being dysthymic,' and I guess that's how it all got started. I've been feeling it creeping up for the last couple of weeks...it's a scary feeling, kind of, but at the same time, it's really familiar and comforting. It's a honest paradox, but that's the only way I can explain it. I really want to get out of whatever this is, but I cannot.  It's horrible because...well, you all know me. I'm the type of person that says, 'If you aren't willing to help yourself, then I won't help you.' And here, all of the sudden, I try to help myself, and nothing seems to work. I keep asking myself why, and none of it makes any sense. I try to cover it up by doing a thousand things, but I really don't care. It's to the point of knowing and believing I have a lot of great friends to help me, but just not caring. It's like I'd rather be down here where I am, where everything around me is going to die or leave sooner or later.   Again, it's been going on for the better part of two weeks, probably before that, but I'm not super-crazy into looking back that far. I just haven't felt the same about things, nothing really gets me up, it's just flat, or it's sinking. I mean, how sad is this: I'm listening to  Glass In The Trees  by Dead Poetic the other day, and I couldn't help but just stopping the car and scream-crying at myself for about five minutes...god, this feeling.   I know a lot of things I can do to help it, I just can't right now. I really need some time off, first of all; second, I need to talk to Abby about a lot of things, third, I need to talk to my mother, fourth, myself...eh. Sometimes I wonder if any of this is going to help. Actually, all the time I wonder if anything is going to work. As I type this post I don't feel that familiar twinge of fear like I used to with Leigh Anne, I just feel flat...really flat, like a cardboard box with an elephant on it flat.   I guess this is better than being upset about everything...like last night, lordy. I felt like I was never going to get out of that, and like I would never pass out and just kill the pain for a while, until I could readjust the chemicals and wake up the next morning.   Man, that sentence I wrote in English today, I thought about it, after giving myself the guilt trip for making a stupid sentence (how predictable), and said, 'man, this is what I sound like all the time now.' Even my happiness is sad stuff. And the hardest thing is explaining it to anyone, because I'm really afraid of what might happen if I do. I think my dad took it alright, he's a really good guy, and he's pretty much been through it all, he doesn't think anything is weird or crazy anymore. But yeah...explaining this is a nightmare. It's like, first, let's tell the story of how it began, and then the story of how it really kicked in, and all the residual aftershocks from last year, and the obsessive thoughts, and the things I do to try and calm myself, and all the guilty thoughts and the guilt in general. First of all, does anyone really want to listen to this, and second of all, why? Not even I do. Then again, if I wasn't hearing any of it, I probably wouldn't be sitting here typing this. Sigh.  I think I think too much, that's what's causing all this. I just don't know. I really just want to sleep a long time and not face anything, just have it face me. Aie, this is suffocating.  It's nice to let it out though, it's something I rarely do anymore, I sort of save til the appropriate blow moment....it's sort of a bad idea. Hm. Well.  I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed now. It's been a long time since I made a good semi-EMO post, and that was a pretty good one. Yeah.    "

Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         ",

If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word 'ideology,' because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.         ",

I only point to the vote counting since that is what the two rulings from the Supreme Court were about and the origin of the 'Selected, not Elected' mantra that Jesse Jackson and others continue to throw out.  I read part of the Greg Palast link.  If that is part of what you are referring to, then I would have to ask about the military absentee ballots that were discarded because they did not have post marks?  While certainly not a monolithic block ,the majority of military votes got to the Republicans.  These soldiers were serving in Bosnia and Saudi Arabia and Korea, but their votes were discarded because of a technicality of the military postal system.  There is no fool proof system.  To assert that the incompetence / laziness of the company (IBT?) was deliberate a full 7 months in advance of the election assigns them the power of clairvoiance to know that the election was going to be decided by the extremely close margin it was.  There is also the assumption that all of the people that were scrubbed (terrible word IMO) would have a) voted and b) voted for Gore (and not Bush or any of the other 5 or 6 candidates).  I don't think you will find many people who live in the real world that think that the 2000 election nationwide, not just in Florida, was unflawed.  There was the judge in St. Louis who ordered the polls to remain open 3 or 4 hours longer in one area for a reason that I can't recall.  That area just happened to be a largely black area and one where the Democrats were going door to door to get people to go vote.  There was also the 'math error' that led the networks to call Florida before the polls has closed.  It is impossible to know how many, if any, people in the panhandle, a largely Republican area, did not bother to vote because of this announcement.  Then there was the voter incompetence in Palm Beach(?) where the people did not know how to read the ballot.  The ballot they used there was the same type used in Chesterfield, and it was 100% clear to me.  It was a mess.  Back to a conversation from many months ago, I think many of the problems (election wise) would be solved if our participation in the process was increased. 50% for the presidential election is downright pathetic.  The reason I think it would be solved is that I think the Democrats would win handily as they have done a better job of selling class warfare (rich vs. poor) and convincing the 'working class' that the government is the answer to everything when compared to the Republican belief that less governemnt is better.  The Democrats message sells better if you don't dig into it, so it would win.  Count me as one of the yays on the legitimacy of the election.  I have no idea on the commission.

Well...there's no one online at the moment...the usuals that I can't exert any social talents on, the robots, the people that I'm just not going to give an SN to right now because I don't want to face up to what they have to say at the moment. So I thought I would just come in and make me a nice little BLog right quick.  So lately I've been playing the role of psychologist, and I must say...it's really weird. I don't know where it comes from but it does, like a little river it flows right out until it's coming like a torrent. The silence thereafter is one of bliss...it's the satisfaction that I got to the core of some long hidden or ne'er disclosed truth.  There was a few days after it first happened when I had to come to grips with myself after feeling that 'unnamed feeling' for the first time, and being able to deal with the fact that I just knew these things, and that I didn't have to know where they were coming from. It was hell, it was feeling hopelessness for just a few hours. And then something clicked when I was talking to Rosie one day, and that little lightbulb just clicked on, and suddenly it doesn't feel that bad anymore, it doesn't seem like I'm entirely helpless, and that I may not be god of the universe, but if I can put a bright spot in someone's day once, that spot can grow and multiply. It's like planting a tree in an empty field.  In other news....I GOT ONE OF MY MICS THE OTHER DAY! w00t! So I have the guitar mic with which I recorded  Master of Puppets ...at least, some of it. DEAR LORD. It sounds so much better than plugging straight in with the POD like I have been doing, not so low end and muddy. So now...have to record all the demos AGAIN. But it's ok because I've grown to love recording. And this time we've been offered some help with the process which would be very nice...Abby already knows how to work the damn thing and that's awesome. So maybe she'll do it and then I'll cry because the recordings will sound even BETTER! Because I won't have to reach for the buttons and cause excess noise when I don't want to. Allz I have to do is twist, plug, and play. JOY! Of course, that is assuming Abby even reads this...I wonder.  Rosie thinks I look....'cute'.....with my little streaked blonde hair bit after getting some sun. Um, well, if she says so. Personally it just makes me look...gay. It's my duty to the world to keep up my facade of darkness and melancholy, and that blondeness just puts a few key dents in the gloomy shell. But I want to get a bit of a tan too so as to not look...so pasty? Sunless tan, here we come.   People are odd.   Well some people, at least. We all get divided into our own categories.  It's a really nice night. Go outside tonite everybody, it's really nice.    "

Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.

      "1": "           When Justice Is Mocked By BOB HERBERT   he jovial voice on the other end of the phone was that of Robert Keahey, the district attorney for the First Judicial Circuit of Alabama, which includes the tiny town of Butler in Choctaw County.  Mr. Keahey is the prosecutor who brought capital murder charges against three retarded individuals for the murder of an infant, despite the fact that he could not show that the infant had ever existed, much less been killed.  If there was anything about the case that bothered him, he didn't let on. He laughed frequently during the conversation, and it was difficult to resist the impression that he found the whole thing amusing.  All three defendants were black and indigent. It turned out that the woman who supposedly gave birth to the baby in 1999, Victoria Banks, had been sterilized in 1995. But Mr. Keahey would not drop the charges. With capital murder indictments looming over them, and the hostility of the local community apparent, all three defendants pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter.  I asked Mr. Keahey how it was first determined that Ms. Banks  who claimed she was pregnant in order to get released temporarily from jail in an unrelated case  was really pregnant.  'She came in weighing about 120 and she left weighing about 160,' he said. 'And the sheriff saw her grow from a thin woman to a fat woman with her belly poking straight out and her belly button turned inside out.'  'Was there a pregnancy test done?' I asked.  'No.' said Mr. Keahey, adding 'There was no need for a blood test or anything like that. You could look at her and tell.'  This was interesting, because a doctor who observed Ms. Banks at the time said he did not think she was pregnant. The doctor wanted to do a pelvic examination, but Ms. Banks would not allow it. When a second doctor reported hearing a fetal heart tone, Ms. Banks was released on bond.  That was in May 1999. When Ms. Banks was taken back into custody the following August, she did not have a baby and there was no evidence that she had given birth.  At that point, Mr. Keahey's prosecutorial power went into overdrive. Sol Wachtler, a former New York chief judge, once famously said that grand juries would indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor wanted them to. Mr. Keahey managed to prove that not only can you indict the sandwich, you can convict it, and send it off to prison, too.  After intense and prolonged questioning without the benefit of counsel, Victoria Banks, her estranged husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker, were all arrested and charged with murdering a baby that  based on the available evidence  was nothing more than a fantasy.   Mr. Keahey said all three defendants confessed to the crime, and that was enough.  I asked if there was any evidence, apart from the defendants' statements, that there ever was a baby.  'We have no physical evidence,' he said.  After the three defendants pleaded guilty and were incarcerated for manslaughter, lawyers for Medell Banks raised enough money from churches and other charitable sources for an examination of Ms. Banks by a noted fertility expert, Dr. Michael Steinkampf of the University of Alabama School of Medicine. Dr. Steinkampf determined that the bilateral tubal ligation performed in 1995 had been effective, and that in his opinion Ms. Banks could not have become pregnant in 1999.  Based largely on that evidence, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently declared that 'a manifest injustice' had occurred in this case and threw out Mr. Banks's guilty plea. But he continues to serve his 15-year prison sentence while awaiting further court action.  The jovial tone in Mr. Keahey's voice changed at the mention of Dr. Steinkampf. 'He thinks he's God!' said the D.A. 'Yeah, that's right. He don't believe any of the good, honest, law-abiding Christian people in Choctaw County when they say the woman was pregnant.'  I pressed Mr. Keahey throughout the interview for any evidence he could offer that the child had ever existed. 'They hid it from the rest of the world,' he said.  When I asked about the possibility of hospital birth records, he burst out laughing. 'She didn't go to a hospital,' he said. He laughed harder. 'If she had gone to a hospital, that would have made it easy.'               ",

      "3": "           Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.          ",

I was on the computer checking my e-mail and blogs and my twelve year old brother came up here and told me to 'get off, I have to do homework' ths sounds like a reasonable request; until you realize he had been on the computer for at least three hours already this evening (we had gotten home approximately three and a half hours before this point, and the half hour not accounted for was dinner) and for at least two and a half hours I watched him play games on the computer.  So anyway, he comes up here and demands the computer again because he forgot to do something, at this point it's approximately 6:30, giving him at least two and a half hours before he has to go to bed, plenty of time to get back on the computer after I get off in less than five minutes.  So I tell him he can wait the five or so minutes it takes for me to check my blogs and respond when I think it's necessary.  He then goes berserk, crying, stomping, whining, screaming, temper tantrum, runs to mommy dearest, and demands she make me get off.  She then yells at me for 'being a computer hog' Anyone whom knows my mother will find this extremely funny because she spends at least ten hours a day on said machine.  And he proceeds to run up here and stick his tongue out at me and generaly look like he won. At this point I'm to this blog and I decided to start a topic about him.  so he tries to get me off for several more minutes, in which I type the message, go to all games free, play several games of collapse, etc.  I finally decide his frequent kicking, screaming, and biting has become annoying and decide to allow him to do what ever it is he's spitting about.  So he sits down witha smug look on his face to print off whatever it was, then he proceeded to go to Big Cheats or some sort site. This I decided would be an ideal moment to unplug the computer.  I didn't; but I did unplug the monitor and make it look like I unplugged the computer.  He then attempted to kill me in that abmisal fashion in which children think their punches actually hurt, but then I put my foot in his face (not kicked him, just put my foot on his nose) and he decided this wasn't a fight he was going to win, so he stormed off. At which point I plugged the monitor back in and shut the big cheat window and went back to what I was doing.    My question is why does he think he can get away with this?  What exactly is it that makes him believe that he can ever get away with this? and BITING? is this kindergarten?

      "1": "           i know jimi will appreciate this article: For Bush, Facts Are Malleable  Presidential Tradition Of Embroidering Key Assertions Continues  By Dana Milbank Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, October 22, 2002; Page A01    President Bush, speaking to the nation this month about the need to challenge Saddam Hussein, warned that Iraq has a growing fleet of unmanned aircraft that could be used 'for missions targeting the United States.'  Last month, asked if there were new and conclusive evidence of Hussein's nuclear weapons capabilities, Bush cited a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Iraqis were 'six months away from developing a weapon.' And last week, the president said objections by a labor union to having customs officials wear radiation detectors has the potential to delay the policy 'for a long period of time.'  All three assertions were powerful arguments for the actions Bush sought. And all three statements were dubious, if not wrong. Further information revealed that the aircraft lack the range to reach the United States; there was no such report by the IAEA; and the customs dispute over the detectors was resolved long ago.  As Bush leads the nation toward a confrontation with Iraq and his party into battle in midterm elections, his rhetoric has taken some flights of fancy in recent weeks. Statements on subjects ranging from the economy to Iraq suggest that a president who won election underscoring Al Gore's knack for distortions and exaggerations has been guilty of a few himself.  Presidential embroidery is, of course, a hoary tradition. Ronald Reagan was known for his apocryphal story about liberating a concentration camp. Bill Clinton fibbed famously and under oath about his personal indiscretions to keep a step ahead of Whitewater prosecutors. Richard M. Nixon had his Watergate denials, and Lyndon B. Johnson was often accused of stretching the truth to put the best face on the Vietnam War. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, too, played with the truth during the Gary Powers and Bay of Pigs episodes.  'Everybody makes mistakes when they open their mouths and we forgive them,' Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess said. Some of Bush's overstatements appear to be off-the-cuff mistakes. But, Hess said, 'what worries me about some of these is they appear to be with foresight. This is about public policy in its grandest sense, about potential wars and who is our enemy, and a president has a special obligation to getting it right.'  The White House, while acknowledging that on one occasion the president was 'imprecise,' said it stands by his words. 'The president's statements are well documented and supported by the facts,' Bush press secretary Ari Fleischer said. 'We reject any allegation to the contrary.'  In stop after stop across the country, Bush has cited an impressive statistic in his bid to get Congress to approve terrorism insurance legislation. 'There's over $15 billion of construction projects which are on hold, which aren't going forward -- which means there's over 300,000 jobs that would be in place, or soon to be in place, that aren't in place,' is how he put it last week in Michigan.  But these are not government estimates. The $15 billion figure comes from the Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group that is leading the fight for the legislation and whose members have much to gain. After pleas earlier this year from the White House for 'hard evidence' to make its case for terrorism insurance, the roundtable got the information from an unscientific survey of members, who were asked to provide figures with no documentation.   The 300,000 jobs number, the White House said, was supplied by the carpenters' union. But a union official said the White House apparently 'extrapolated' the number from a Transportation Department study of federal highway aid -- not private real estate -- that the union had previously cited.  The president has also taken some liberties as he argues for his version of homeland security legislation. He often suggests in stump speeches that the union covering customs workers is blocking the wearing of radiation detectors. 'The leadership of that particular group of people said, 'No way; we need to have a collective bargaining session over whether or not our people should be made to wear these devices,' ' he said in Michigan last week. 'And that could take a long period of time.'  The National Treasury Employees Union did indeed argue in January that the radiation devices should be voluntary, and it called for negotiations. But five days later, the Customs Service said it saw no need to negotiate and would begin to implement the policy, which it did. After a subsequent exchange between the union president and Customs Service commissioner, the union wrote in April that it 'does not object' to mandatory wearing of the devices.  The Customs Service said the delay had less to do with the dispute than the fact that customs lacks enough devices (about 4,000 are on order). The White House and Customs Service said the dispute was settled in part because Bush had the authority to waive collective bargaining, although he did not exercise it.  On Sept. 7, meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at Camp David, Bush told reporters: 'I would remind you that when the inspectors first went into Iraq and were denied, finally denied access, a report came out of the Atomic -- the IAEA -- that they were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need.'  The IAEA did issue a report in 1998, around the time weapons inspectors were denied access to Iraq for the final time, but the report made no such assertion. It declared: 'Based on all credible information to date, the IAEA has found no indication of Iraq having achieved its program goal of producing nuclear weapons or of Iraq having retained a physical capability for the production of weapon-useable nuclear material or having clandestinely obtained such material.' The report said Iraq had been six to 24 months away from nuclear capability before the 1991 Gulf War.   The White House said that Bush 'was imprecise on this' and that the source was U.S. intelligence, not the IAEA.  In the president's Oct. 7 speech to the nation from Cincinnati, he introduced several rationales for taking action against Iraq. Describing contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq, Bush cited 'one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year.' He asserted that 'we have discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet' of unmanned aircraft and expressed worry about them 'targeting the United States.'  Bush also stated that in 1998, 'information from a high-ranking Iraqi nuclear engineer who had defected revealed that despite his public promises, Saddam Hussein had ordered his nuclear program to continue.' He added, 'Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists,' an alliance that 'could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints.'   In each of these charges, Bush omitted qualifiers that make the accusations seem less convincing. In the case of the al Qaeda leader receiving medical treatment, U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that the terrorist, Abu Musab Zarqawi, was no longer in Iraq and that there was no hard evidence Hussein's government knew he was there or had contact with him. On the matter of the aircraft, a CIA report this month suggested that the fleet was more of an 'experiment' and 'attempt' and labeled it a 'serious threat to Iraq's neighbors and to international military forces in the region' -- but said nothing about it having sufficient range to threaten the United States.  Bush's statement about the Iraqi nuclear defector, implying such information was current in 1998, was a reference to Khidhir Hamza. But Hamza, though he spoke publicly about his information in 1998, retired from Iraq's nuclear program in 1991, fled to the Iraqi north in 1994 and left the country in 1995. Finally, Bush's statement that Iraq could attack 'on any given day' with terrorist groups was at odds with congressional testimony by the CIA. The testimony, declassified after Bush's speech, rated the possibility as 'low' that Hussein would initiate a chemical or biological weapons attack against the United States but might take the 'extreme step' of assisting terrorists if provoked by a U.S. attack.  White House spokesmen said in response that it was 'unrealistic' to assume Iraqi authorities did not know of Zarqawi's presence and that Iraq's unmanned aircraft could be launched from ships or trucks outside Iraq.   Some of the disputed Bush assertions are matters of perspective.  Bush often says, as he did Friday in Missouri, that 'because of a quirk in the rules in the United States Senate, after a 10-year period, the tax-relief plan we passed goes away.' There is a Senate rule that required a 60-vote majority for the tax cut, but the decision to let the cuts expire was based on pragmatic considerations. Proponents of the cut from the House and Senate -- both under GOP control at the time -- decided to have the tax cut expire after nine years to keep its price tag within the $1.35 trillion over 10 years that had been agreed between lawmakers and Bush.  Other times, the president's assertions simply outpace the facts. In New Hampshire earlier this month, he said his education legislation made 'the biggest increase in education spending in a long, long time.'   In fact, the 15.8 percent increase in Department of Education discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 (the figures the White House supplied when asked about Bush's statement) was below the 18.5 percent increase under Clinton the previous year -- and Bush had wanted a much smaller increase than Congress approved. Earlier this month, Republican moderates complained to Bush's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that the administration was not spending the full amount for education that Congress approved. Daniels said it was 'nothing uncommon' and decried the 'explosively larger education bill.'    2002 The Washington Post Company           ",

While her tormentors take a break, she finds herself alone in a room with a figure curled under a bloodstained sheet.

Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.

Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says 'or prohibiting the free excercise thereof.'  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?

Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.

      "1": "           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             ",

Are there any times when violence is right?  What a difficult question to answer.  Ever since the terrorist attacks on the US last year, I have believed that it is necessary to use force.  We gave the Taliban time to turn over Osama bin Laden, and they let it run out.  As a result, we dropped bombs on them.  On a much smaller scale, I think about times when my wife and I must discipline our daughter.  We have set up boundaries and expectations for her.  When she goes outside of those boundaries, we have a moral obligation to discipline her, so that she can learn to respect authority.  Sometimes, then, we need to spank her.  Other times we remove priveleges.  I believe that the United States and its allies have taken a similar approach in the war on terrorism.  Basically, President Bush has stated that terrorists will be disciplined for their acts of terror.  Financial assets have been frozen.  Also, we've used military force.  Thus, I see our current situation as one in which the use of force is justified.  The principle is the same in law enforcement.  A police officer tells a gun-wielding suspect to drop his or her weapon.  If he or she does not, then in some cases, the officer may have to use deadly force.   What do you think?

My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.

But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.         ",

From: Jms at B5 (jmsatb5@aol.com)   creator of Babylon 5, for those not in the know   Subject: Today We Lost Richard Biggs  Newsgroups:    rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated   Date: 2004-05-22 16:43:06 PST      I was awakened today with several phone calls from cast members and Doug to pass along the terrible news that this morning, Richard Biggs passed away.    We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.  We may try to have some kind of fund raiser to help give whatever assistance may be helpful for his kids.  We all miss him terribly.   jms     UPDATE: here's the   CNN  article concerning his passing.         ",

My mom just cited an article that said that 'kids who spend more that 4 hours a week on a computer have lower grades and are more likely to get addicted to 'IT''  my mom spends more than 50 hours a week on the computer, not working, but playing mindless games.  What's the difference? Why is her spending more hours on the computer than i do at school not as bad as me getting on the computer just long enough to check my E-mail and type this up.  I do this 7 times a week.  Does that mean im addicted?  I spend maybe 7 hours a week on the computer and 7 hours a day at school.  Where do my priorities lie?  She spends 50 hours a week on this very computer im sitting at right now playing mindless games such as Destruct-o-match.  I spend 7 hours comunicating.  Hold on a second, does this seem just a little bit hypocritical?  O wait, I forgot, no one is grading her on anything.  Let's hypothesize what her grade would be like if she was being graded right now...she would be in the 65-68 range, and she complains about me getting a 91???  Additionally time how long you spend on the computer just for the purposes of communication (E-mail, this, etc.).  You probably will be over 4 hours for the week.  That means that the second part of the study cited above is useless.  The only thing it says is that if you have a computer, you are more likely to get 'addicted' to it. Sorry for my little rant, but I had to get that out      "

Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         ",

Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.

For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end.

Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.

As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.

The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         ",

According to the Federal Times, the president's appointee at the Office of Special Counsel ruled that federal employees will now 'have no recourse if they are fired or demoted simply for being gay.' (2)   While the Bush Administration says it is legally prohibited from firing a person for their conduct, they have the legal right to fire or demote someone based on their sexual orientation. To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. (3)  Not only does the new directive contradict the president's own promise to treat homosexuals as equals under the law, but it also contradicts what the Administration told Congress. As noted in a bipartisan letter from four Senators to the Administration, 'During the confirmation process [of the president's appointee], you assured us that you were committed to protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to their sexual orientation.'

I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).

My first quiz in Block II was a 100, the next block however, has a washout (failing and having to re-accomplish) rate of about 40%.  My nose will see two colors, black and white.  Weather has been rainy until Monday, then was nice.  Humid but nice.  I am not use to wearing my blues to school or work for that matter.

Respect for flag No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.  (a) The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.  (b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.  (c) The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  (d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.  (e) The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.  (f) The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.  (g) The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.  (h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.  (i) The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.  (j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.  (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning  I do not think the Code has been modified to account for stickers and magnets.  Note that the prefered way is through burning, just not in protest.  I know that many VFW and Foreign Legion Posts hold ceremnonies each year to dispose of flags and that these do involve burning the flag during a somber ceremony.         ",

However everytime I start down to do something I remember how I was told to do it.  Whenever my mother speaks to me she uses a tone which I can best describe as the same tone one would use to a muddy dog whom just tracked mud throughout the entire house, including the vacuumed carpets and mopped floors.   How my mother even knows about these tones is unclear seeing as she never vacuums or mops.  And when I say every time I mean every time, such as 'Good job, Will on your 99th percentile on (insert standardized test here)' and 'Do you want to help me with scouts tonight' and who could forget 'Fix [this computer that isn't working because I decided to try to play every game that I could find online and tried to get at least six trojans to detonate in less than ten minutes and no one but me has been on in at least two weeks so I am the only one who could have possibly caused these problems] NOW!!!' So after responding in kind I get screamed at for 'yelling when I have not been yelled at' and 'Never showing her any respect.'  Would someone please tell me when it was that people felt that just on the fact that they have wasted more years of their life they deserve respect.  I have notice that lots of the people I have dealt with this year don't believe that respect is earned, but given to all 'superiors' (people whom have less time left here because they spent it jacking off). So every time I start something productive that my mom told me to do, I grate at it continously.  How this is supposed to get me to do anything well.  It really does hurt my grades, think everytime I start to actually do homework or study or read or anything I just remember her screaming that I'm a spoiled shithead not worthy to kiss her feet and that my total worth is less than that damn non-existant dog that tracks mud on floors in other people's house.  What the fuck is her rational behind this god damn tone.  Well at least this has one up side, I won't have much trouble adjusting to college life, seeing as it can only be better than this hell. thanks Mom, really I'm grateful for you making my life one big living hell.

As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          ",

    "query_text": "           Eva - Perhaps you could explain to me why a single cent of the $20 billion dollars the  US is paying  for reconstruction should go to any country that opposed the _____ (insert your preferred term for the action taken).  If France, Germany, or Russia wish to pony up their own money to reconstruct things and get their contractor's to do so, then let them.  But, as I understand the basis of their arguements, they are upset that we won't let their contractor's bid on projects being paid for with US (and maybe UK?) money.  Mir - Some?  Yes.  Enough to do the job in the near future?  Doubtful.  In my dealing with Contractor's, I have found most of them to be so tight that they squeak and that they claim not to have two pennies to rub together.  So, odds are, except for management and certain ultraskilled positions, they will probably hire Iraqi's to do alot of the work as a cost savings method.  If you bring over your American crews, you need to pay much more (travel and housing) versus using someone local.  I hope and think that most contractor's will do that (see, greed is not always bad)  As far as the medical question goes, your conservative comment seems to imply that you think only conservatives are rich and powerful.  I recall a survey, several years old now, that was looking at the net worth of U.S. Senators.  You might be surprised to learn that there were more Democratic millionaires than Republican.  I honestly don't remember if was a 45 to 40 thing or a 10 to 5, but that is not my point.  There are quite a few rich powerful liberals that aren't champoining these causes either.  Also, do you think that no research is being done on either of the two diseases you specifically mentioned?  Angie can correct me here if I am wrong, but I think that fibro was only recently (last 3-5 years) actually classified as a disease.  I don't think you can expect too much research on a disease most doctors don't know even exists.  I would expect that research is underway now.  As for autisim, I know that research is being done.  There has been some recent finding that some medium used to prepare or administer childhood vaccinations has a mercury compound in it.  There appears to be some connection between the that and autism.  It must be a recent finding, because in 2000, nothing was said about this to us when Katherine got her immunizations, but everytime we get a shot for the twins, it is included in the information given to us.  It does make me ask the question, what is worse - losing your child to mumps, rubella, or polio or having them permanenetly disabled by the prevention?  That's not a choice I really want to make.  Keep in mind that there is only one pot of money for medical research, currently provided by both the public and private sector.  That money has to be divided up amongst AIDS, cancer, MS, heart disease, paralysis and a myriad of other diseases/conditions that I did not mention.  I have much more faith in the private sector to get the most out of this finite pot of money than I do the government.  I have worked for the government and currently work with government programs.  The bureaucratic BS and innefficiencies are maddening.  Money is held up because a form was not filled out 100% correctly or because some Congressman has not had his chance to make a press release about getting the money for his district.  At least with the private sector, they want to get breakthroughs so they can get the return on their investment.  It really is sad that someone is going to benefit from someone else's suffering, but I can't think of a better motivator, since there are very few people in this world who are solely devoted to the relief of suffering (like Mother Teresa was).

At one point, I went to the bathroom, they said something  really  horrible to her, she started crying.   I think she hates me now...after everything, after I ALMOST fucking had it.  'I love you' she said last night. I was able to make her laugh for hours, I was able to do it all. I was perfect. And now this shit, and Leigh Anne's taking it out on me for shit they said.   It  amazes  me how pathetic my luck is. I just really want to take everyone I've met this year, all my friends and everything, and scream at them til I lose my voice, sleep it off, and do it all over again until I choke on blood and die. I really cannot believe how much my friends want me to die, thinking they're doing the 'good deed' for me by ruining things with Leigh Anne. She's hurt me a lot, but these things are in the past, gone forever, I can forget about that weakness I had, I can forget the depression, but somehow the scars it created seem to come back and haunt me, the scars surface and they never forget how I treated people when  I  was in darkness.  Somehow it's fine for Leigh Anne to take everything out on me, when I have a bad day. If something bad happens to her, like she said, 'If you knew what happened to me today you'd know that I really don't need this (being cussed out/whatever happened by Lindsey and Rosie at the meeting)', then NOTHING ELSE bad can happen. Even if it's not me but my friends. I'm supposed to take responsibility for my actions, like it's all my goddammed fault. Why is that, Kenzie? Why is it that she can only see the bad in me when we're not together, and she only sees the good when she's at her worst, and I'm at my best.  At some point, her and Lily put down the phone. I've been sitting here, waiting, listening to the silence, for the past hour and fifteen minutes for someone to pick up, because I want to sort this out and get on with it.  I FUCKING CANNOT BELIEVE MY LUCK. I CANNOT. GODDAMN.  Will something please turn out right and stay that way, please?

A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'  please read the rest of the article to get the full story on how airport security has gone bezerk -   Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.   Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do with Dr. Rajcoomar.  Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.   They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident, already scary, could  and should  have ended there. But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down.  One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.  The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane.  'I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,' said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. 'I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout.'  Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, 'It was really like Rambo in the air.' She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot.  There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell.  This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.  Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.  Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B. McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.  The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident 'too closely.'

I'm having some problems at home, and there's a little internal conflict...some ghosts from the past are taking this situation and amplifying it...it's hard to tell the whole story and I really don't want to think about it.  An interesting side note: Leigh Anne called me tonite....at least, I think so, because I was on the phone and didn't answer. But the hangup was concurrent with Leigh Anne's...so let's pretend it was her. What makes that more interesting is that she is in Australia, and that kind of call, just for reaching the answering machine like that, is probably going to run her (or Lucas, or whoever's floating the bill) about 30 bucks. I hope you all had tissues to stop the resultant flood of tears of joy.  Now, two things...first of all, I was watching the movie  Crimson Tide  today. For those of you who haven't see it, it has Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman in it. Basically, the whole movie is about them fighting over if they should launch a nuclear warhead based on an incomplete transmission from the government...they get a first transmission that tells them to fire, and then another, which is stopped because they get attacked...but Denzel Washington (Hunter) says that it might be a stop order and that they should not fire, but Hackman (Capt. Ramsey) says they should, because an officer is meant to act on orders already given. And they fight, one party takes over the ship, the other party takes over the ship, some people die from a missile attack that sends damage out of control, and the people trying to fix it die, there's a guy that dies of cardiac arrest from inhailing too much smoke in the galley...so there's really no redeeming deaths in this movie. To complicate matters, the movie ends with the order actually being for the launch to not be carried out, and everyone is happy cuz there wasn't a big nuclear holocaust.  The thing that is really ironic about all this is: it's a great movie, and no one dies from fiery nuclear death. Wouldn't it be so much better if a bunch of Russian suckers died from us accidentally lauching a nuke at them? Think of the  drama !  Sum of All Fears  was good for that reason, because all those peeps died from the nuke going off...that is, in the movie...I haven't read the book, and I remember my dad making some reference to the fact that the nuke actually didn't go off in the book, but that might have been for something else. But nevertheless, the movie ends as such. The irony therein, is that the ending is actually good, and that the movie has you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is the genre called  Suspense ...which further proves that humanity is really stupid. The movie just ends basically, and it's them stealing a boat back and forth. WOW. And still, a great movie.  The second thing is... NEW METALLICA IS OUT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There's just one BIG problem.....I fucking hate it. I'm sorry.....I LOVE METALLICA, let me say right now, they were my first, they were the first to defile my ears, and for that, I love them. But the fact remains...this album sucks. The vocals and drums are WAY too loud, first of all. The lyrics are horrible and cheaply inspired. Whatever happened to those good old days of  Master of Puppets ? How about  Metallica/The Black Album ?  ...And Justice For All ? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? Those good lyrics are gone, replaced by cheap, rehab ridden rhymes...barely rhymes most of the time. He takes topics like anger and makes them into...pop songs, almost, except for the fact he's using the word 'fuck' a bit. The guitars are so detuned, you can't even hear them, most of the time. There's no solos at ALL. So fars anyway...I've only been able to listen up to track four. The titles are awful, as well...for Metallica, anyway.  Frantic  and  St. Anger , the title track are ok names, and songs as well...but after that... Some Kind of Monster ,  Invisible Kid ,  Sweet Amber ...not only are the titles bad for Metallica ( My Friend of Misery ,  Harvester of Sorrow ,  For Whom The Bell Tolls ? COME ON!), the songs are worse. FUCK. But the artwork is good, and there's a DVD that comes along with it, which is ok, altho it features all the sucky songs of  St. Anger  and Jaymz trying to be cool with them....even tho they suck. I love the OLD Metallica, I just can't respect this new........fucking....... POP ........Metallica.   That's all guys....there needs to be a public apology to Rosie here too, even tho I sent her an email...I'm really sorry for dicking off at you here. Give me some time to sort all this shit in my head out and it won't happen again.     "

Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).

As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.

      "1": "           Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws.

BHS was ranked #298.  So multiply 1000 times 50, plus and extra like 2000 schools for Texas and California.  That means that we're 298/54000ish.  Which means BHS is in the top 5% of U.S. schools, meaning SCHOLARSHIPS!!!!  Not only that, but we were the only Tennessee school, both public and private, on the list.  I think that means YAY BHS!!!  and I'm not exactly one for school spirit either.  I went and borrowed all the books we're supposed to read for AP from the library.  Have I started on them?  No way, I''m not that motivated.  Anyway, I'm going to my grandmother's house to try to help calm my cousin down a bit about this baby thing.  Or at least help her realize that she really  is  having a baby.  I don't think it's fully sunk in yet.  But it should be fun...er, interesting.  I'll still be on the blog and on my e-mail and stuff though, so nothing should be changing, but if you need me, call my cell, and if you don't have the cell, then call Abby or Liz and they'll tell you cause I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving my phone number out on the internet.  Anyway, um, that's about it.  I sat on my bum today and did a whole bunch of nothing, so there isn't anything else to say.  I'll let you know when something interesting happens.  Someone get in a fight or something so I can at least be entertained for a while.  I need entertaining badly.  Ok, that's it, it's movie night, so I gotta go.  It's Whit's night to pick, so it could be interesting...      "

The FAA has specific requirements for the grades (steepness) of runways, taxiways and the areas surrounding them to provide a safe operational environment.  Local, state, and Federal requirements then dictate that the designs be accomplished with the smallest amount of impcat to waters of the US, wetlands, and forests (especially in Maryland - the tree is as holy as cows are in India).  It all ends up being a balancing act of safe environment, limited environmental impacts, and minimizing costs (which are 95% funded by the FAA).  In the end, the owner usually does not have too much input on the specifics of how something is done, after all that is what they are paying me for.  They just want their new runway (in this case) and leave the details to us.  To answewr your question, we go to the middle ground as much as possible, if for no other reason than it is legally required.  If I did not have these restrictions, my job would be much easier, but also way more boring.    It is kind of funny because in WWII there were alot of airfield constructed.  In Virginia alone Norfolk, Richmond, Newport News, Roanoke, Suffolk, Franklin, West Point, Emporia, Petersburg, Accomack, and Danville were all constructed in the early 1940's.  For the most part these were built by the Army on swamp land.  Today, they would never be built, because of all the wetland (swamp) impacts.  The group that oversees wetlands?

However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys[sic]. It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  '  i have no problem with that; you have every right to be pissed off, just as the protestors have every right to piss you off.  onward; you also said:  '  Flag Burning - I think it should be illegal. As I said before, it is extremely ironic that people will chose to burn the symbol of the country that allows them protest peacefully without getting thrown in jail or worse.  '  the irony is interesting, and somewhat intentional, no doubt; but more importantly, the act of burning the flag identifies the protest in question as a serious one, garnering the attention of the public that the protestors are looking for in regards to their cause.  it shows people that they're mad about what our country is doing - so mad, in fact, that they feel like burning their own flag.    ' People will say that burning the flag is an expression of free speech. Hog wash. If burning something is free speech, then the KKK cannot be prosecuted for burning crosses as a symbol of what they believe.  Free speech does not just apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable.  '   assuming you meant to type ' Free speech [just] does not apply to the things that are considered socially acceptable ', tell me, then, if this is what you're saying:   that americans who burn the american flag in a show of protest against US policies should be arrested, because it is socially unacceptable for them to do so, considering they're citizens of a country that lets them protest  without  being arrested.    the definition of what is 'socially acceptable' is just a vague as the definition of 'free speech'; more so, in some cases, given the fact that social standards differ from person to person, city to city, culture to culture... even within the US.    i would daresay that infringing on the rights of others in regards to their own individual pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is unacceptable.  that means i shouldn't be allowed to burn anything on your personal property without your express permission, whether it's a flag or a cross.  doing so on public property, though, is another matter entirely.  that means that *any* group, whether it's white supremisists or dirty hippies, has the right to express themselves in whatever way they see fit, provided their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.  this rule means i could be exposed to plenty of activities and ideas i'm not happy with; but if i am certain of my convictions, they will be made all the stronger via the comparision.    furthermore, ridiculous ideas and beliefs tend to get  stronger  if repressed, not weaker. better to let everything out into the light of day; after a day or so, you'll be able to distinguish between the profound and the poop, via the smell, if you take my meaning.

The main purpose in doing this is to get this stuff down so that I don't forget.  I also invite your input.  If I could sum it up in a word or phrase it would be Documentation and Organization.  I rememember when I worked as an Environmental Engineer for Alcoa Building Products, documentation was key to showing our proof that we complied with environmental laws and regulations.   If it wasn't in writing, then it never happened .  With that mindset, we needed to have well-organized files.  I remember the color scheme for the different types of environmental 'media' (for lack of a better word): blue for water/wastewater, green for solid/hazardous waste, orange for toxic chemical information, red for air resource management, and so on.  We even had a document that described our file-keeping system.  The intent of this was to provide quick and easy retrieval of documentation in the event of an audit and for future reporting.  Our family has a number of things going on that merit good recordkeeping practices.  For one thing, both my wife and I are actively looking for employment.  Mileage and other job search expenses are tax-deductible, provided you have documentation.  And we need to keep track of contacts, companies to whom we've sent resumes, follow up correspondence, and so on.  Additionally, our daughter Keisha, has hearing loss in both ears.  Several times we've needed to provide documentation for insurance, education, and medical reasons.  And then there's the bills.  Holy cow!  Bills for everything related to running a family.  There is a huge need to document that bills were paid, along with conversations with creditors and other individuals.  I think a big reason why I've procrastinated in the past is because I've dreaded all the effort in getting this information together.  I see now that if I put forth the work up front to get organized and document things, then, when the time comes to retrieve that information, it won't appear as daunting.  So, you could say that I'm having another kind of a 'birthday' today.    ",

      "4": "       I sometimes wonder, as I do right now, what the fucking bleeding hell I'm doing.  Here I sit clicking my life gone once again, ever acknowledging with each and every breath in the Turkish philosophy sense of the words, that I am dying this very minute, and that every breath I exhale, and everytime the blood in my heart delivers that wonderous life-giving oxygen to the rest of my body, every goddamned time, it's inevitably meaning one more stroke of the steel to the flesh, one more beat that causes this flesh irrevocable damage, the beat shall never return, the damage, however small, is leading us onward inevitably towards that black, aching pit called death with no light, no future, no sounds. Only silence and the grim realization that the past, just as the future and the present, are truly nothing. That the very whim of creation was to take life and let it make choices, mostly ones that would destroy it, and then lead it to black at the end of its time, from whence it came, and where it all will inevitably wind up.  Death.  It feels the same way at this moment, as it did when I put my mouth on the end of that 45 and dropped that goddamned baggage for a few seconds, the wonderous beauty of liberation, and the horror of clarity, that life is a pit, and we are the bastards deemed to find the bottom, in life or without life, but inevitably, we will reach the bottom; some of us will taste it before we meet it, and some of us will hit it before the rest of ourselves can catch up. Some of us just weren't meant to see the clear and the wonderful I hear about. Some of us are made to prematurely taste the bottom because nature says there has to be a balance. If the world were without people that weren't fixated on their own destruction, it would mean a race of people engaging nature and fully working against it, a species that would inevitably rise above the confines of nature.  They put the ones alive on the bottom here so that we are inhibited as a whole, not all of us will unite, we are the ones to show everyone else their own eventual damnation. We were put here to circumvent rising above nature, and nature does this by utilizing our most potent and, in the man-beast sense of the word, only tool: our very minds. Our minds were bred of destruction for survival, the art of survival is destruction. Some of us may only compensate for the full awareness of our inevtiable demise by cutting ourselves in the mental sense, thereby achieving equalibrium again: you cut, you rise back above, you sink back down. Balance through imbalance.  Yet nature doesn't take into account that its scales may be unevely weighted. Equalibrium comes with acceptance: we have a choice to accept this middle ground or not, which, sadly, a great few of us do not, and of those great few, there are varying degrees of non-acceptance. Many who believe themselves to be upon the middle ground do not take this into account, and thereby further incriminate and induce self-destruction upon those that cannot accept their constant exposure to inevitability.  I came into this world with a choice: the choice to live, or the choice to die. I have taken a long, subjective look at this world and everything it stands for, how it lives, how things work within it, how things are carried out, how we breathe, how we survive, everything about it I have surveyed for as long as I can stand, and I have decided that, though I continue and will continue to stand among the living, I choose death, because death is my fate, death is my perception, death is the only option to those who have felt the bottom as strong as I. Death comes with the sadness of grief that always hits a human with loss. I feel no relief, I feel only the comfort of acknowledgement, that my path is set, that I believe this, however morbid, that life comes to death and that this, like everything, is inevitable. Everything, absolutely everything eventually comes to it, your happiness, your longevity, your well-being, all of these things will be ruined by it. Why not let things slip away when you are already so attuned to it?  Goddamn this world for bringing me so close to the pit, yet leaving me still so far away.    "

We contacted our insurance company, who, by the way, told us that our insurance had been cancelled.  Yet they started a claim for us.  We contacted the police department, and they told us our car had been repossessed.  So Jennie is staying home from work today while we figure out what we're going to do.  We've already contacted the creditor and left a message with their 'reinstatement' department.  So, now it's our turn to wait for the return phone call.  This is a good exercise and overall lesson for us.  I can see that.  To deal with the emotional stress of this situation, I have reopened some existing scabs, and I realized that it's been my typical method of dealing with it.  I either try to avoid the stressful situations altogether, or I deal with it by creating physical pain.  The physical pain is something I'm better at controlling than the emotional pain.  I'm glad that I'm realizing this.  I'm also glad that Jennie is here so that we can work together as a team.  One thing we've realized is that communication is a weakness in our marriage; there have been a lot of assumptions and expectations that have been unrealistic or, better yet, not made known.  I pray to realize the strength and power I have to deal with the emotional stress in a constructive manner.  I pray to be able to communicate my thoughts and feelings openly, constructively.  I'm also grateful for the medication and therapy.  I can tell I've been very distracted this morning, and it's helpful not only to realize this, but also to have someone else around to help reign me in.  Please keep praying for us!         ",

D.' for good shrinking skills, WHEE! So I bought a little notebook to analyse stuff like that and put other random stuff. For instance, starting today, in about three or four years, I could tell you what I had for breakfast... TODAY . I'll definitely be breaking that little clich in no time.  I'm seriously diggin' Psycho-logy because it has less to do with facts and more with gut instinct and personal thought, and for some reason it's a really easy class to connect with. I've only been in there two days and it's my fav. ever.   Plus I've been thinking of being a shrink for a long time, so that just ices the fragging cake.  In other news...I was almost finished recording another song ( Problems ) and suddenly my room decided to have a problem of its own in the matter of voltage...the room is f0cking dead. Well sort of. It has to do with messing up my gain structure...or how much sound I can get without getting distorted. So right now, I can get almost no volume and all gain. So for what you hear, it's a little fuzzy buzz in the background. And it was going SO WELL! The gain was  PERFECT  on the drums, all I had to do was some decibel adjustments and now they sound GREAT. And the bass went  INCREDIBLY  too, it sounds really nice and I got a good reverb (sort of shower room echo, that's reverb) on it too...and some delay (takes part of the sound and broadcasts it a few seconds later) which makes it sound even better. And THEN...the   ALMIGHTY RIFF   that goes in the chorus along with accompaniment rhythm. So I was about to do the heavy guitars.  Eh? Why's the little bar-mahickey not going up?  For those of you less educated in musical terminology, 'bar-mahickey' refers to the digital readout of gain I'm getting from the source signal, in this case, my guitar. Now you know, fools. HAHAH JK  It was really cool in Mrs./Ms. (married? I dunno) Bayrd's class today because she was making fun of Confederations and she talked about one going on in the 1980s. She believes that these people should look at past confederations and see the mistakes therein, but because they didn't, Mrs./Ms. Bayrd let go a booming, 'FOOLS!' and continued on. So from now on, when I'm slightly peeved at someone or trying to be annoying, I shall be using the terms 'YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK!' and 'FOOLS!' at whatever juncture necessary. Along with 'w00t' and 'downer', as Lindsey can attest that I did today, to Julian for some reason.   Julian didn't point out the fact that  Downer  is, in fact, a Nirvana song, and I thought he was the biggest Nirvana-head ever. He made fun of my cKy pin today and asked me if I liked EMO...wherever the hell he gets that cKy is EMO...plus, EMO is badass anyway, yo. Taking Back Sunday, for instance. ASS-BAD.  So guys, that's it. I'm really long winded and I should be shot with a gun or bow and killed. Thank you for your time.  This is J-Funk-Killa saying 'PEACE!'    "

I love the snow, the cold, the brooding, the deep thought, the vodka, the fear, the paranoia, the lust for life, the memories of an empire gone by -- even the Communist menace was far more interesting and, dare I say, romantic than the rather dull juggernaut of capitalism with its good-old-boy GIs and giant golden arches looming over some foreign treeline.  I even miss seeing the uniforms and goose-stepping military parades of my youth.  And there is some small part of me that remains disappointed to this day that Soviet paratroopers never landed in the courtyard of my high school.  They are great chess players; they have delicious names; and they always longed for a warm-water seaport.  I dunno.  Just something about them, I guess.

I have to do it again; but next year it'll be even heavier :) Not too sure of the songs yet, but you can bet we'll probably die of cardiac arrest onstage next year. As for shock value, ask Z...I heard they tried to get Keidel in the mosh pit, and one guy said it was the first time he'd ever seen Keidel frown. I was stunned. It was kinda depressing seeing the pit going really strong for a few minutes, and looking up two minutes later to find it gone. But the ending was great, even I thought it was pretty damned good.  And more details today in fifth period, of course :)      ",

If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They 'evaluate' people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.

    "query_text": "              Navy Summary of Mishaps - First Edition     Note:  I got this from ME, who is stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.    A.  Jackie Gleason used to say that he drank because drinking took warts and moles off other peoples faces.  What he failed to mention is the fact that booze, as a universal solvent, immediately liquefies all the cells and synapses in those areas of the brain having to do with judgment, coordination, and common sense; turns them to mush.  Afterward, its like trying to cogitate with a cranium full of Cream of Wheat.  Here are three quickies to illustrate my point:  --  A n airman with a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.22 decided it would be the coolest thing ever if he jumped onto the back bumper of a departing Honda delete Sol to see how long he could hang on to the trunk lid as it sped away.  Got to give the kid credit for tenacity.  He stayed with it till 50 miles an hour, when his fingernails failed structurally, at which time, parasitic drag dumped him onto the highway.    --  A  pickup truckload of our Coast Guard brethren left a bar and headed down the road with four drunks in the cab and two more drunks passed out in the bed.  (Yes, as it turns out, our friends in the funny hats are human, too.)       After they dropped their first shipmate off at home, they regained the interstate and were headed for the second guys house at about 55 miles an hour when, like a scene from Night of the Living Dead, one of the corpses in the back stood up, wobbled slightly, stepped stiffly over the tailgate and disappeared into the glare of headlights from oncoming traffic.        Suddenly everybodys sober.  They screech to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Everyone bails out and races back along the interstate in a frantic search for their buddy.  But they cant find him.        Wait!  There he is!  Face down in the middle of the interstate  backlit by the headlights of a car that has him bore-sighted!        Time compression kicks in as they all wave their arms in slow motion and scream (in an extremely low register), 'NOOOOOOO!' Trying, to no avail, to ward off the inevitable.  Thump-Thump.  And the car sped off into the night  didnt even slow down.        But you know what?  The guy lived!  I mean he was messed up big time, but he lived, which means, in the face of this new evidence, that I must retract my previous statement.  Them Coasties aint human after all.     --  A s soon as a drunken Marine ditched his liberty buddies and headed back to the base, he spied a restaurant and thought hes stop in for a bite to eat.  The fact that the restaurant was closed didnt slow the sergeant down a whit.  This Marine wanted chow and no bars, no locked doors, and no alarm systems were going to stand in his way.        Perhaps it was the cold food or maybe it was the slow service, but something must have really irritated this guy because after hed been in there a while he began to tear the place up.        It wasnt long before the gendarmes, summoned by burglar alarm, arrived and tried some of their high-powered psychology to coax the Marine outside.  But, he (totally impervious to logic) wasnt having any of that and told the copy to take their best shot.        Well, in this case, the cops best shot happened to be a ninety-pound German Shepherd, and they told the hungry Marine that if he didnt come out, they were sending Bruno in.        'Bring him on!'  says the Marine.  And so Chief Wiggims let slip the dog of war.        BA DA BING!  The dog is on the Marine like white on rice and showing absolutely no respect for the sergeant.  Actually, Brunos finding the sergeant to be a rather zesty morsel (kinda like a slider at Mid-rats), and the fact that the Marine decided to fight back only served to whet the dogs already prodigious appetite all the more.         In the end, of course, the score was Drunken-Devil Dog - zero, Regular Dog - five.  (Five being the total number of useless fingers dangling at the end of the sergeants right arm that  ever since that night  have refused to respond to his commands.)         B .  I always get burn severity messed up.  Cant remember if its third degree or first degree that leaves you looking like a burger that fell off the grille and lay unnoticed on the coals for a spell.        I will say this, however.  I got this second degree burn stuff down pat, especially after I dumped boiling water and equally boiling coffee grounds on my hand one morning recently while trying to brew a cup of java while I was still asleep.        But that was small change compared to what a drunken seaman did not long ago.  It seems that six beers and a couple shots of bourbon convinced this guy he was an acrobat.  After ditching his buddies at the bar, our here made it back to the pier Ok.  But there, the lure of fame and the challenge of the high wire were more than he could resist.  So, instead of plodding drunkenly along on something stable and flat link the concrete roadway, this would=be Flying Wallenda jumped up on the CHT piping that ran parallel with the pier and began tippy-toeing along its length toward his ship.  And he was lookin gooooood, beloved.  Until, that it, he encountered a knot of pumps and valves that squirts a solution of highly caustic hypochlorite into the raw sewage.  There, he stumbled and fell.        But, true to his calling, he wasnt going down without a fight.  He frantically grabbed for a handhold  anything to break his fall, and he snagged one!  Unfortunately, what he snagged was one of those high pressure chemical lines which immediately popped out of its fitting and sprayed our hapless hero from head to toe with a caustic bath of searing hypo-chloride.        At the hospital they catalogued his misery as: second degree chemical burns of the groin, the abdomen, left thigh, right ear, left face and left arm.  And, for good measure, a third degree burn on his inner right thigh that nearly fried his oysters and will require several skin grafts.        But I did get a chuckle out of the unbridled optimism of this report, which said that, after five days in the hospital and 35 days out of work, No permanent disability is anticipated.'  Yeah, right.        I burned my hand two months ago and its still as pink as sunrise except when it turns purplish red in the shower and throbs like mad if I get it in warm water.  Dont let anybody fool you; this guys going to be in pain for a long, long time.         C .  I read in the paper this week that Daimler-Chrysler has embarked on a program designed to provide job security for the entire traffic safety section of the naval safety center for a good many years to come.  With the rollout of their new Dodge, V-10, pick-up truck, we enter a new era of potential disaster.  When one considers that sailors in the past have actually managed to break telephone poles in half using just a motorcycle, the possibilities for carnage, mayhem, death and destruction posed by this new, 150-mile-an-hour, 4000 pound, unguided rocket in the hands of your average North American blue jacket are enough to boggle the mind.        Heaven knows theyre doing a more than adequate job with the tools at hand today:         A  carload of sailors were on their way to a little weekend liberty, when the kid in the right seat spilled a drink in his lap and then turned and started ragging the driver about his erratic motoring skills.  The driver barked back.  So, in response, the passenger dumped what was left in his cup on the drivers leg you know, just to give him a feel for what its like to be facing a night on the town looking like youve recently lost control of your bladder.  This brought a heated retort from the driver, who totally failed to see the humor.  At which time the passenger doubled up his fist and smashed it into the windshield (Take that!), and the driver responded by slamming on the brakes and skidding headfirst into a mini-van in the opposing lane of traffic.         A t a party Saturday night I met a woman who teaches anger management to elementary school children.  I found that highly amusing until she explained to me there is real value in early training for the still undeveloped infantile mind in the techniques for handling stress and managing anger.  Maybe Ill give her these guys address to see if she can hook them up with some kind of correspondence course.  It couldnt hurt.  --- end of post ----         ",

And sorry to everyone else if I slighted you in any way, just hear me out first.  The day started out normally...sort of. I woke up after four hours of sleep, not being able to get back to that euphoric state of rest and feeling generally sluggish. I went and drank some really strong coffee. Then I took my Doryx, a face medicine. Without food, Doryx, in me, causes a chemical reaction that induces serious vomiting...that's why, when I was on my way to the movies to see XMen 2, I pulled over on the side of Ellington Parkway and vomited my guts out for the duration of fifteen minutes. Had I a simple cracker on hand I could have been safe. But no; I puked my guts out and sat down to breathe for another five or so. My dad pulled off (he took the driver's seat after this), and we had lunch with a friend at the Baja Burrito downtown, whereafter we saw X2, and it was wonderful. After it was over I got a call.  It was my mom. She said she had found my cat, not that he had been missing. It was that he was dead. I didn't really cry over it, but it got me to thinking about everything and it really seemed pointless. That's when I went to the library and, in those memory-filled surroundings, I composed that post. I haven't read it since, nor do I plan to.  I went home then. At home I sat around, I tried reading, I found my mind coming back to this post and the general reaction to it, I figured no one would really like it. I didn't care. My dad was watching TV, and he saw a commercial for Sonic.  'Let's go,' he said, 'see if we can get back before eight,' to WATCH A TV SHOW.   The drive was quick, dad was over the speed limit at least twelve miles an hour the whole time, but we made it. The order was quick, and we left just as quickly.  Coming down Ben Allen Road there is an intersect with the I-96 exits. A Lexus waited, wanting to make a left turn.  Dad was doing 50, 10 miles over the limit on Ben Allen.  The car rolled out too far and stopped in the right lane, My dad changed lanes.  The car rolled into the left lane, which we were presently in, and stopped.  I heard the breaks screeching, I saw it coming and gripped the sides of the car hard. I had enough time to scream, 'Oh shit.' Then it was chaos.  The initial punch of the airbags was loud. It shattered my side of the windshield into a million piees and my open, screaming mouth caught a few, which I would be coughing up for the duration of the night. The belt caught me hard on the shoulder and tore it a bit; I had a mild lasceration and a belt-shaped bruise over my chest. I did not touch the bag. My dad, on the other hand, caught him full in the face; he got a bit of a shiner and his shoulder is beaten up pretty bad. And I got covered in vanilla flavoured Coca-Cola.   I managed to reach over and turn off the car, I could smell the transmission about to start on fire, coupled with the excessive sulphurous smell of the bags freshly deflated. The first thing I did was get out of the car, scream 'FUCK!' to an audience of awe-struck people, and began kicking the car yelling the profanity until I remembered the lady in the gold Lexus, who was not getting out of her car.   Her leg was stuck and she had some diaphragm damage. The resultant ambulance and  five other emergency vechicles  were able to take care of her, not to mention the FIVE police men.   My dad's car was totaled, the Lexus had its axle bent in half, so the tire is like '/' that instead of '|' this.   There was a concrete island for one of the on-ramps, and I sat there, eating fries, reading Rosie's French dictionary, clutching my bleeding shoulder, and shaking my head as I looked up at the smoking wreck every few minutes. I read until the sun went down, and then I just stared at the wreck until they took it all away, I got into the back of a police cruiser, and we sped toward my house. The cop did  twenty over  until we got home. I got my mom to pick us up, I took two Benadryls, and I knew no more.  Jerry Cantrell once said 'Dying a little bit helps you appreciate life', and I really think it has.  Sorry all, and excuse me while I go spit up some more glass.      "

So, if I examine mine and others' lives according to what the Scriptures say, since we'll be judged according to that standard (  John 12:47-48 ), there is nothing wrong with judging.

Specifically, on April 23, 2003, the president sent his top international aid official on national television to reassure the public that the cost of war and reconstruction in Iraq would be modest. USAID Director Andrew Natsios, echoing other Administration officials, told Nightline that, 'In terms of the American taxpayers contribution, [$1.7 billion] is it for the US. The American part of this will be $1.7 billion. We have no plans for any further-on funding for this.'  The president has requested more than $166 billion in funding for the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan this year. But instead of admitting that he misled the nation about the cost of war, the president has allowed the State Department 'to purge the comments by Natsios from the State department's Web site. The transcript, and links to it, have vanished.' (The link where the transcript existed until it caused embarrassment was   www.usaid.gov/iraq/nightline ).  When confronted with the dishonest whitewash, the administration decided to lie. A Bush spokesman said the administration was forced to remove the statements because, 'there was going to be a cost' charged by ABC for keeping the transcript on the government's site. But as the Post notes, 'other government Web sites, including the State and Defense departments, routinely post interview transcripts, even from 'Nightline,'' and according to ABC News, 'there is no cost.'  This story is not the first time the President has tried to hide critical information from the American public. For instance, the president opposed the creation of the independent 9/11 investigative commission, and has refused to provide the commission with critical information, even under threat of subpoena. Similarly, after making substantial budget cuts, the president ordered the government to stop publishing its regular report detailing those cuts to states. And when confronted with a continuing unemployment crisis, the president ordered the Department of Labor to stop publishing its regular mass layoff report.  It is also not the first time the administration has sought to revise history and public records when those records become incriminating. As the Post reports 'After the insurrection in Iraq proved more stubborn than expected, the White House edited the original headline on its Web site of President Bush's May 1 speech, 'President Bush Announces Combat Operations in Iraq Have Ended,' to insert the word 'Major' before combat.' And the 'Justice Department recently redacted criticism of the department in a consultant's report that had been posted on its Web site.'  Read the   Mis-Lead .         ",

      "0": "              Bible Study: Overcoming   Recently while reading some passages in Revelation, I was struck by how often Jesus Christ uses the word 'overcome.'  I thought it would be worthwhile to examine these passages more closely; especially given my present struggles, which I've mentioned here and in   Letters to God .  First of all, there is the word  overcome .  It signifies that trouble, hardship, and the like are  normal  in the life of a disciple of Jesus Christ.  He himself said, in   John 16:33   In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.  We are guaranteed that we will have troubles during our lifetime; our focus, therefore, needs to be on overcoming these things as we journey homeward.  Secondly, I'm encouraged by what   Jesus Christ says will happen to those who overcome , which I've included in the list below.  I've emphasized the words signifying the promise to those who overcome.  'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God  (  Revelation 2:7 ).' 'He who overcomes will  not be hurt at all by the second death  (  Revelation 2:11 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  some of the hidden manna . I will also give him  a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it  (  Revelation 2:17 ).' 'To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give  authority over the nations --      'He will rule them with an iron scepter;      he will dash them to pieces like pottery'--  just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him  the morning star  (  Revelation 2:26-28 ).' 'He who overcomes will, like them,  be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels  (  Revelation 3:5 ).' 'Him who overcomes I will  make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God ; and I will also  write on him my new name  (  Revelation 3:12 ).' 'To him who overcomes, I will give  the right to sit with me on my throne , just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne (  Revelation 3:21 ).' 'He who overcomes will  inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son  (  Revelation 21:7 ).' I don't claim to know all the answers with respect to the symbolism in Revelation, but everything here sounds wonderful, and it encourages me to keep on going.  I'm reminded of   Dory's conversation with Marlin, in the movie Finding Nemo :  Dory:  Hey Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?   Marlin:  No I don't wanna know.   Dory: [singing]  Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.   Marlin:  Dory, no singing.   Dory: [continuing]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho! I love so swim. When you want to swim you want to swim!   Marlin:  Now I'm stuck with that song!. Now it's in my head!   That's what we need to do, even though we don't know exactly where we're heading in the near future.  Just keep swimming.  Lastly, I'm reminded of this quotation, which I found only recently: 'A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective.' --   Andr Gide           ",

Oh yes, The senior and junior boys some how got a hold of water balloons during the trip. Last night they decided to bomb the Senior/Junior cabins around 12:30. SO around then they climb up to our area...seperate area safty thing...but they were seen by another cabin so to shut them up they bombed them. Then the middle school girl counselor told them that she would help them get us. She walked in (by this time everyone is awake) and asked us to go on a night adventure and to be careful. We locked all the doors and they pelted us with water balloons. Allie then tells Kara to open the door and see if the guys are still there. My bunk is right by the door so as they open the door i get this wonder full view of them screaming (high pitched) and running behind another bunk because allie got hit by a balloon in the mouth (Yes! Go boys!). Anyway the wonderful duo forgot to pull the door close so that the boys have freedom to pelt more balloons into the room. On busts on the ceiling and then dripped onto someone's bed. Another plopped itself on the floor and created a socking carpet. Another landed perfectly cradled on a sleeping bag of a counselor. The couselor grabs is a runs outside ready to pelt them...she's not fast enough. The girls are completely furious and want revenge so we hit them hard! Guys hate periods and pads and tampons... and we didn't have any water balloons so guess what the boys found? Ao we colored the pad and tampons with red lipstick and then soaked them in water...the rain helped.  Then we all snuck down to the boys cabin and found that Brian and some other guy were on the porch...we hauled A to get back to the cabin. After that we sent the 7 senior girls...juniors next year... to plaster then on the porch. We had planned to spell out U Lose but they didn't have time. Amber...really fast... told the others to run as she smacked a pad...very loudly... on the the glass door and threw a blood bomb (tampon...wet) into the cabin. Around 2 we snuck up again and found the guys cleaning up tampons and pads...i love counselors... Also it turned out the we pasted them on the frosh and sophmore side of the cabin so they had alittle girl education as the older guys watched. Phil already has something planned for next year... anyone have any ideas for the girl's come back? Oh yes... I'm running on minimal sleep because of them so I got to be grumpy all day...oh yes a suffocated phil on the buss too. I love retreats. THe speaker had dreadlocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's 28year old white male that has dreadlocks. He's awesome because he has ADD and made the whole Deut. 6:4 interesting. that's the verse on loving the Lord your God with all you Heart, Soul, and Might. Heart was about love and choosing while Soul was unconditional love. He's put off God for along time and he actually told us to lean into our doubts and explore. That way our faith is our own and we trully will find Chris for ourselves.  OH YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! We played football...or rather I watched. I forgot to bring another set of clothes and such. Anyway the Brentwood Bowl was won by the Girl Team named the Cootles...Anyone know what a Cootle is? The trophy was a rubber football with a rose on top while the guy's won a plastic moose...dear...buck thingy. They weren't sure. SO...retreat was awesome. 9th Hour was awesome too. they were the band    "

This time I didn't miss on purpose: I got home at about seven and a half, whereafter my mum reminded me that she had to go to work in Nashville. Technically, I could have gone with her and taken the car back to Franklin, but that would require me paying for the gas at some point, and then having to drive back at rushhour and pick her up. Which doesn't diminish me being a bastard any less, I'm so sorry Rosie. I'll give you the printed booklet with calligraphic lettering for the 'high in vitamins and minerals, 100% delicious!/we're poor' demos. That's the name of this fourteen song wonder. At least, that was the name I put on it while sitting in the parking lot of BUMC this morning.   Three talking tracks and a coupla myuzik tracks. And more to come soon, as my drum teacher gave me the right cables I needed to make the drums sound totally L337. It's only a matter of time now, then you can all claim to know a rockstar...eagh, I dun wanna go.  I was just reading this backlogs on The Blog...memories! They're all their now so check 'em out all. God, where was I all that time? I read over the posts and it was like, 'did all of this really happen?'. I've read them all before, but whatever, I'm just a dumb kid.  I did some major photography work today. I mainly wanted to waste the rest of the pics on there so I can get this reel developed and get the pics of my wonderful, beloved Loser Girlfriend. But there's other cool pics in there too. Like the token self-shot, I just aimed the camera and clicked. Those always turn out...interesting. And how about the one of my pocket, where I was talking to Abby about cool shots that just turn out cool, and then proceeded to take one of the innards of my pocket, that was a good one. And then the art shots, like the inside of the piano.  Alex and I wanted to do some interesting concept art for  Ignorance . Alex wanted a picture of two hands together, one reading 'Ignorance' and the other, 'Arrogance', because the two go hand in hand. I did this picture today, using a Sharpie and a red dry erase marker. To take the pic I mounted it on one of my amps, poised my hands in front of the lens, and used my tongue to hit the shutter release. It was a great shot.   Then I did some. One is of a rusted and cracked knife that's been used lately...in blood, running down the blade is the word 'BLEED', which comes up several times on the album and would probably justify the effort as thematical in nature.   I did another 'hands' picture, which was full of symbolism. It depicts my hand with the word 'IGNORANCE' in red, reminiscent of blood, of course. I painted my nails with one coat of black and then quickly rubbed it off, so the nails have the look of death or something, it's really creeped out. And, the hand is clawed, as if in agony. This whole scene is supposed to represent three important themes. One: PAIN, the clawed hand, the wound that reads 'IGNORANCE', the word pain comes up several times, and it is the result of ignorance. Two: BLEED, the red colour of IGNORANCE, what it feels like to be ignored, having those codependant whims as I once had. Three: IGNORANCE, the total picture, an etching of blood in the hand, the clawed grip and deadened nails, the whole scene is reminiscent of pain and punishment. The total psychology of the picture, tho, will tell you that the person therein did not deserve whatever pain he/she was getting, and thusly leads everyone to feel the anger and stuff.  I also came up with some really good lines and two useable songs today. I haven't name one of them, the other is named  Wrecked , and it sounds a lot like  Broken Me , lots of rhythm singing and whatnot, and some really messed guitar and bass...I was trippin' on Nirvana's  I Hate Myself and Want To Die  when I wrote it. And notice, the one word song title. I've been doing that a lot lately...some of the most recent song names  Soak ,  Feeder ,  Down ...then others, like  I'm Just A Bastard ,  The Schizophrenic Song , and  Grandpa Was a Schoolbus Driver , not to mention that wonderful classic,  EBAMahickey , which is going to be totally revamped at some point, so that we can talk about the Ebamahickey ripping through sinews, muscle, and bones at 9107349817320941293481623049 plus decibles. I love being a rock guy.  I'm sorry to bore all of you with this crap, guys. Agh. I just love talking about this wonderful band stuff. I'll admit, it's really boring to everyone else, but it's something else watching everything take shape as it is now.  I'm going to shut up and go to bed now. Ciao for niao buddies.     "

He said if such a thing happens, we wouldn't be able to count on the support of France.   I told him that it didn't surprise me. Since we had come to France's rescue in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and the Cold War, their ingratitude and jealousy was due to surface (again) at some point in the near future anyway. I also told him that is why France is a third-rate military power with a socialist economy and a bunch of pansies for soldiers. I additionally told him that America, being a nation of deeds and action, not words, would do whatever it had to do, and France's support, if it ever came, was only for show anyway. Just like in All NATO exercises, the US would shoulder 85% of the burden, and provide 85% of the support, as evidenced by the fact that this French officer was shopping in the American PX, and not the other way around.   He began to get belligerent at that point, and I told him if he would like to, I would meet him outside in front of the Burger King and whip his a** in front of the entire Multi-National Brigade East, thus demonstrating that even the smallest American had more fight than the average Frenchman.

Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.

Jennie helped pull one of them out.  Keisha looks so cute, with the one tooth hanging down in the front of her mouth!  We've already talked about how I'm going to call the tooth fairy, who happens to have dog treats for those houses that have dogs.

Needless to say, she's been a little excited.  Earlier, however, she was a bit lethargic, having had a cold and runny nose.  This morning, for example, while we were taking Jake for a walk, as we waited for her bus to arrive, she sneezed and her nose leaked a bit, if you know what I mean.  Then her bus arrived, and the driver asked if I had a tissue, and I replied that I was going to ask her the same thing.  She handed Keisha a paper towel instead.   This just in : Keisha showed me the tooth, and, as I held it, this conversation ensued: 'Daddy, you know what I was thinking?  I was thinking that, tomorrow morning, you could give me a 'prise (i.e., surprise) because my tooth came out.'  'You already have the tooth fairy coming out,' I replied.  'I don't think it works out that way.'  'I know,' she said, 'but I was thinking you could get me a doll or something like that.'  'I don't think so,' I replied.

It was from all kind of angles, but all focusing on Bush and the fact that the 200,000+ people there didn't want to be counted amongst a 'silent majority' welcoming him to Britain and, by extension, tacitly approving his various charming exploits, from Iraq through the clamp-down on civil liberties in the US to 'missile defense', the Kyoto protocol, his stance on the ICC (the International Criminal Court, not the online chess site), illegal holding of prisoners, including British citizens, at Guantanamo Bay and the little fact of his having seized power in the world's most powerful country and our most important ally, with a flagrant disregard for democracy.   It was also a protest against Blair's offering up our country as 'the mother of all photo-ops' (not my phrase - comes from the ex-Foreign Secretary) to the incumbent during his re-election year. As the head of the Labour Party, it seems pretty perverse of our Prime Minister to grant such a PR boost to a pretty extreme Republican administration.    You also said:   'I will repeat the question: What should be done *now*?   Nick responded to this as well: he addressed concerns that people have from many countries, including the US, in regards to Bush's policies in Iraq; it is safe to say that any or all of these issues could and should be addressed immediately.  What is your response to this?  Beyond his list, aren't there a great many other things that can be done now, from changing our tactics in Iraq to overhauling our foreign policy in the middle east overall?    'Oh, yeah, and what to do about Iraq?  Immediate moratorium on any contracts to multinational companies based in any of the invading powers, hand over control to the Arab League with a UN Resolution pledging aid to the restoration of democracy, and invaders to end occupation ASAP.  But I'm just speaking off the top of my head.'    Also, your posts regarding different 'what do i do with  this  flag?' scenarios were clever and hilarious; it helped point out the absurdity of the whole notion that you can make it illegal to burn or otherwise destroy a symbol, which by its very definition cannot truly be destroyed anyway.  Because IT'S A SYMBOL, damnit, NOT the tangible thing that it represents!          ",

I've received another email from a good friend serving not only in the US Navy in Operation Iraqi Freedom, but also most importantly God Almighty.  He writes: Hey, Hey!!  How is everything for you back there?  Things were a little rough for me the past couple weeks but I'm praying and working through it.  There have been a lot of rumors going around as to when we might come home.  During the Captain's inspection of our department she was asked to clarify the rumor for us. She did not give us a date but did tell us which rumor was closest.  Sorry, I'm not at liberty to mention even that right now.  We still have not seen port yet. That is frustrating. We thought we were going to very soon but that too looks like it won't happen for us. Yesterday most of of ship had a day off. There was a volleyball tournament in the hanger bay. It would have been a safe place had they not left the hanger bay doors open. We heard 'Willlsonnn!!!' (from Tom Hank's movie    Cast Away  ) called out over the ship's intercom (we call it the 1MC) as we watched the volleyball go sailing through the hanger bay doors. Alas the SAR (Search And Resue) Swimmers were unavailable for the rescue. I hope that's not the case if we lose one of us ;) Maybe the ball will make it ashore and some kids will be able to enjoy it.  About your prayer for the war. I do not claim to know the heart of God or his mind, but this is my view on the war so far. I know many of you have been praying for a swift victory and few casualties. As in the days of the Old Testament, when God threw our enemies into confusion, he has seemed to protect us again. Yes we have had casualties but they have been very few compared to what could have been. We are finding Iraqi armor completely abandoned. We have literally captured groups of soldiers as they sleep (in the day time) and we took the Bagdad airport by surprise and with little resistance.  Even the Iraqi casualties, though large, could be even greater than they are. Through all of this many of their civilians have expressed great gratitude upon our arrival. The Iraqis do want liberation. They will probably want to hold on to their muslim beliefs but this liberation and freedom will make it easier for disciples [of Jesus Christ] to go in. This appears to be a ripe time for God to harvest. I'm just trying to offer some perspective on my view of the war. I hope this helps to build your faith in your prayers for the outcome of this.  Remember, as much you think about us over here, we are thinking about you back home :)  YBiC [Your Brother in Christ],  Dave          ",
      "1": "           thought this might infuriate john and chris; inspire ben and well, i guess just me and ben - Director Moore criticizes U.S.-Iraq war  March 23, 2003  |     Michael Moore criticized President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq during his acceptance speech at Sunday's Academy Awards, drawing a partial standing ovation and some jeers from Hollywood's elite.   The documentary maker won his first Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, but he brought the other nominees on stage with him in what he called a show of solidarity for nonfiction during these fictitious times.   We live in the time where we have fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president, Moore said. We live in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether it's the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of orange alerts.   Applause gave way to some boos, as the orchestra began playing to cue the filmmaker to leave the stage.   We are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Moore shouted.   Afterward, host Steve Martin tried to restore levity.   It was so sweet backstage, you should have seen it, Martin joked. The Teamsters were helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.   Bowling for Columbine was Moore's exploration of gun violence in America. The title refers to the fact that gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling before they opened fire at Columbine High School in Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves.   Asked backstage why he made the remarks, Moore answered: I'm an American.   Is that all? a reporter asked.   Oh, that's a lot, Moore responded.   He dismissed the jeers he received, telling reporters: Don't report that there was a split decision in the hall because five loud people booed.   The rotund, scruffy-bearded activist from Flint, Mich., also directed the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, in which he pursued former General Motors Corp. boss Roger Smith to confront him about the collapse of the auto industry in Moore's hometown.   He's also the author of the best-selling book Stupid White Men ... And Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation, which criticizes American politicians for favoring corporate wealth over public well-being.   Scattered appeals for peace and grim reports from the U.S.-led war in Iraq added a sober contrast to Hollywood's traditional night of glitzy self-glorification.   In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace, Chris Cooper said during his acceptance speech for best supporting actor for Adaptation.   Cooper was among several nominees, including Meryl Streep and Martin Scorsese, who wore dove peace pins on their formal wear as a silent statement about the war          ",

It does not matter if he  already has one. I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain.  As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. No one knows why.   Rule #2:  If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word  ratchet or socket in it. Men love saying those two words. 'Hey  George, can I borrow your ratchet?' 'OK. By-the-way, are you through  with my 3/8-inch socket yet?' Again, no one knows why.   Rule #3:  If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car, a 99-cent  ice scraper, a small bottle of de-icer or something to hang from his  rear view mirror. Men love gifts for their cars. No one knows why.   Rule #4:  Do not buy men socks. Do not buy men ties. And never buy men bathrobes.  Once I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, he  wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.   Rule #5:  You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn  out. If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the  little picture in the corner. Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips,  and flips....   Rule #6:  Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. If you do, it will sit in  a cupboard for 23 years. Real men drink whiskey or beer.   Rule #7:  Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or  deodorant. I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.   Rule #8:  Buy men label makers. Almost as good as cordless drills. Within a couple  of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. 'Socks. Shorts.  Cups. Saucers. Door. Lock. Sink.' You get the idea. No one knows why.   Rule #9:  Never buy a man anything that says 'some assembly required' on the box.  It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.   Rule #10:  Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, ParrLumber,  Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire.(NAPA Auto  Parts and Sear's Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. It  doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. 'From NAPA Auto, eh? Must  be something I need. Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane?  Wow! Thanks.')   Rule #11:  Men enjoy danger. That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue.  Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. Tell him the  gas line leaks. 'Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?'   Rule #12:  Tickets to a Seahawks game are a smart gift. However, he will not  appreciate tickets to 'A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts.' Everyone  knows why.   Rule #13:  Men love chainsaws. Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. If you  don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a  label maker.   Rule #14:  It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension  ladder. Never buy a real man a stepladder. It must be an extension  ladder. No one knows why.   Rule #15:  Rope. Men love rope. It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least  the Boy Scouts. Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8' manila  rope. No one knows why.       "

The restaurant had recently installed a   wireless networking system  (I don't know the tech term for it.), and we all wanted to see what it was like.  I was impressed.  There were approximately 20 laptops connected, and the speed was 1 MB per second!  I showed one of the guys   my fotolog  as a test of a page with some pictures.  It downloaded in a fraction of a second.  Pretty cool stuff.  I also met some other folks who are looking for work.  One guy pointed me to   LinksToJobs.com: the single job posting source for Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus, Ohio !  I've added it to the link roll, where it should be aptly put.  Actually, I headed over to the bar and picked up an   NTN game player .  The guy who sat down next to me was an unemployed CFO - Chief Financial Officer.  I suppose there's not a big demand for folks fitting that job description in the Dayton area, huh?    ",

      "2": "           BTW, the toxoplasma stuff comes out in the news every few years with the intention of shocking pet owners.  'Oh, it's not my fault for being a slut...my cat has infected me with promiscuous disease.'  If rats are infected, it causes slight behavioural changes, thought to increase the chance of transmission.  Well, it causes no behavioural changes in infected cats.  In humans also, there has been no conclusive evidence to show that behaviour is directly affected by the parasite.  They 'evaluate' people's personalities, and then test if they have the disease.  Well, that ends up being a correlational study.  How do you know that people who like cats don't have certain behavioural characteristics already?  Or that people who are more likely to clean litter boxes don't have a certain personality?  Or maybe people who don't clean their houses are more likely to get it since they would be the most likely candidates for rat infestation.  There is no ethical way to show if there is any truth behind the claims that it supposedly has mind-altering effects on humans.  The only way to test for the personality change would be to test their personality before and after infection.  Comparative studies are the only ones that would be scientifically worth anything.  For now, the claims are total bollocks...   Off the subject, did anyone else think that the 'Matrices' were absolute shite?  Yuck!         ",

But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few 'A-List' blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!  This posting is   GoMeme 4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,   GoMeme 1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.  Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results.

      "3": "           Ben - I read some of the article and skimmed other parts.  It takes a little longer than 15 minutes to read it all.  I cannot believe that the author(s) is harping over 'discrepancies' of 2-3 minutes on some of these events.  If you take a room full of 30 people and ask then waht time it is, I can almost guarantee that you will get answers that vary plus or minus five minutes from each other.  As far as the opening statement that he knew we were under attack at 8:48, I strongly disagree.  It is very easy to sit here a year and half removed from the attacks and state what we know to be true now.  At 8:48, all anyone knew is that 1 aircraft had crashed into WTC.  At least 1, possibly 2, other aircraft were out of radio contact and were not transmitting on their transponders.  It could have been coincidence (a terrible accident and electrical failures on the planes).  I would not be surprised if the message, as it was passed up from ATC to other people (SS and NORAD), that they insisted on confirmation before taking any drastic action.  That obviously changed when the second plane hit.  As for why Cheney was immediately scooted out of the White House and Bush was not out of the school, think for a minute.  If you were flying over DC (which was difficult before 9/11 and impossible now), you would very easily be able to locate the White House, Capitol, monuments, and other known land marks.  I bet that if you were flying over Richmond, a city you know well, you would have a hard time locating specific non-descript buildings like a school.  Now think about a terrorist, with only basic flying abilities and limited knowledge of the target area.  They would have an extremely difficult time locating the school.  Bush was as safe as he could be at the school.  No plane was going to crash into the school.  The White House was a very likely target.  Cheney was in more immediate danger than Bush.  As for the differences in the accounts by various people, does that really need explaining?  Different people, different priorities, different personalities, different memories.  I don't know who or what this group is, but they sound almost as bad as the French author that tried to say we attacked the Pentagon with a missile.  There is no conspiracy here.  The CIA did not kill JFK.  FDR did not have advanced notice of Pearl Harbor.  Aliens did not crash in Roswell (ok, I might not believe that one).  Monica Lewinski was not a plant by the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  The US Navy did not shoot down TWA 800.  Did I miss any?         ",

I made it extremely difficult to near-impossible by not making it a public BLog. It's still out there, it just can't be searched for. And to find it, you would have to experiment with different website addresses. A worthless hint, I just wrote a new song and put it as the address of the website. And again, you'll never find it. HAHAHAHAHA. That was kind of the point though, so that I could finish it and then post it. I'm just not doing it here because of it's sheer size...and I don't want comments on the work in the making, because that would screw up most of the story line and I would be PISSED. Especially since this is taking a billion years to work out. There's mini-essays to sort through, lots of lyrics, conversations to remember, letters to re-read...mostly, lots of stuff to remember, sequence, and write down. It isn't incredibly hard, it just takes time to figure out which piece goes where...most of the year I took as a single strand of conciousness, and now I have to take that thread and unweave it into its most essential elements.  It should be done by the end of summer or so...ok, not that long. It'll take a long while, but I'll get a lot done this weekend...after the part on Saturday of course, and it should be finished before you know it. A lot of it, all of you know already, since most of you star in it in some way or another. Basically, if you've read this site and TinHaven on a regular basis for the last two months or so, and I have open communication with you, you have a part in it somewhere. And then, there's stuff that's been in the BLog before and will be posted as part of the story again (i.e.: the 'goodbye' letter, etc.). God, you're all going to love it and hate me for some things you never thought I knew but actually did know anyway. HATE, I can taste it already.  GUYS IT'S MY BIRTHDAY HAPPY B-DAY TO ME. Surprised that I made it this far. Pray for me on the driver's liscense test tomorrow, I'm more worried about the eye exam than the test, but it would be nice to have support nevertheless. When I pull up to your houses by myself in a car tomorrow, grinning my cheeks off, imagine the feeling of sheer joy and excitement you'd get from knowing that you well-wished to a good cause.  Propaganda is awesome.    ",

About the militarisation of space, I agree with John that it looks like being inevitable at this point - not that I think we should be happy with that.  That NASA is the mechanism via which the public can be made to fund military research is nothing new, either.  Most high technology, from telecoms to nuclear weapons, is a result of public subsidies. The main  raison d'etre  of the Pentagon system was to set up this system. Once the public has paid the cost, the technology gets turned over to private enterprise to collect the profits (I believe the term for this is 'free enterprise').  And if the private enterprise gets in trouble, the public bails them out. Yay! Risk-free capitalism!   We have satellites and computers because the Pentagon and NASA covered for it (in the US - we have our own versions too, of course.  I think Alan Turing got military funding, for instance, although don't quote me.). These things are now profitable, so they get handed over to big private corporations.  This is an open secret - it's not talked about much in public, since most people don't like it when they realise they're paying to make rich people even richer, and effectively underwriting any risk, but on the other hand it needs to be known in the right sectors because, well, companies have to know where their free money's coming from.    'This transfer between public and private industry is called Spinoff at NASA.'   The Bush stealing the election thing...  It's funny how every pro-Bush comment I ever read focuses on ballot-counting and chads, as though those were the most scandalous things going on.  The best book I've read on the Florida debacle is  The Best Democracy Money Can Buy .  Honestly, I didn't even think it was controversial to say he stole it, but the front page of today's Independent says that 54 per cent of Americans believe he was legitimately elected.  What's your impression in the belly of the beast?  Also, can anyone point me to the investigative commission that concluded it was stolen?    Greg Palast  told me about it, but we were interrupted as he was telling me where to find it and I haven't had much luck searching online.  Hope you're all well.         ",

What a slacker art I.  Well, this weekend hasn't turned out all that bad. I've done a lot of thinking about things, I think I have a start on what I want to say to Abby and my mom, I talked with my dad for a long time (5+ hours), we came to a lot of conclusions, tears, etc. It's a pretty cool thing walking in on two guys EMO tearing together. I drank Coke and sat against the security door, he sat on a chair across the kitchen and sipped some water. And man, all that from saying, 'Can we talk later?' Something gives me the feeling that because of that, things are going to start to get better. And that simple phrase made the balance of 3 years' misery diminish and start to die. Well, alright, and there was five hours of talking, but the catalyst wasn't a total breakdown or anything. I think I like this method a lot better.  Hey, what can I say? Even I'm starting to feel a little better. I hit rock bottom the other day, sure. It's not everyday you almost break up with someone you love and are trying to get back to somehow. Finally, I can sort of stop the obsessive thoughts, I can rationalize my cognizance somewhat...rational-emotive, what a charm. I'm really hoping that life, after taking a big turn towards a tree for a while there, is starting to turn back onto the highway and pressing the gas to get the hell out of this town. It's just that these pills make me damn sleepy. Sigh.  Well...I don't know what to say. Today was a pretty good day. I was able to sit in quiet places and not freak for a change, I thought things through and wasn't totally catastrophic in all the outcomes. I may just be learning to trust people. It seems like such a turnaround, but I have a lot more to go, I know. But the turnaround gives me some place to start, thus: hope. And who couldn't use a bit of that now and then? I really hope things do turn about. God, I have a lot of catching up to do.  I really wonder why I shut up and let things slip by. Actually, I wonder what gave me away. Hm. Yeah, it's all sort of centered around Abby right now, that's one of the biggest problems in my head right now, but I don't feel hopeless about it for a change, I feel like we can actually make some progress now that all, or most, of the bullshit is cleared out of the way. God, I came so close, we came so close. I really love that girl, I wouldn't just let her go that easy. Linds has said that girls get into relationships looking to change the guy a bit...I could use it. That was random, I forgot why I put it (it had a point). Hmm. I just don't have enough time. Things need to be 100% now!  Ah well, I'll just do psychology tests in the meantime. Those things make me feel thrilled.  And I'm still working on that omelet, Linds. I'm trying to find a good recipe and some time to make it, but man, the goal is going to be fulfilled. And next, to key an asshole's car. Not for any mundane reason. I'm looking for an asshole parked in a handicapped space without tags or a window dealy or whatnot. I've always wanted to do that, and now I'm going to. I don't know what the city codes say about emus, but hell with it. They're too dumb to cause any damage, the poor buggers.  Go see Army of Darkness, it's the funniest movie ever!     "

Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).

I'm at camp...still...the food still sucks, the worship services are still too long and we still have 4 and a half hours of free time left, during which time I plan to take a shower, sing some songs in a fictional language, raise some money for this guy who says if we raise $50, he won't shave his head (he has very nice hair) and maybe take a nap, and some other various projects.    This keyboard sucks majorly.    Well, what else have I to say?  I still have 49 minutes left on my little time card thingy for the cafe.    Tonight there is a 'talent show' which, hopefully, our little group is going to perform Row, Row, Row Your Boat in Ubbi Dubbi in a round.  Thats only if Linds and Becca and I can actually get the last line up to speed, and then sing it in a round.  It should be interesting to say the least.   The speaker dude we have is a jerk.  I don't like or agree with any of his philosophies, and he talks to us like we are complete idiots who don't know what we are doing in life and all that jazz.  Yeh, so anyway, that's all I really have to say.       ",

      "1": "           My take on the whole 'saving people' thing, speaking as a Christian, is that I feel as though the best way to convey my beliefs to others is to live as an example of them.   To me, the true message of Christ was one of inclusivity, understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and above all, love.  And being a Christian to me means living a life that is 'Christ-like.'  Though I know that I am by no means without sin, the most important thing for me is to live my life with love and compassion to the best of my human ability.  As for the film...  I have yet to see it.  I think I'd prefer to see it privately in my own home, because my faith is very strong and very personal to me.  I feel like I might leave the film feeling like an open wound, and I don't want to risk being around insensitivity at a moment like that...  But as for the way it is marketed...  The movie business is still just that...a business.  It is an unfortunate reality that, if you want to put asses in seats, you have to have some sort of draw.  Since James Caviezel is not yet an A-List celebrity (though I think he could be...he's a brilliant actor), his name alone is not enough.  And while many people love Mel Gibson, the masses of asses in seats tend to prefer a Mel that is in front of the camera, not behind it.  So producers, wanting to make money on a film that they know is monetarily risky, come up with a way to sell the film, i.e., 'the TRUE story of WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.'  Whether or not it is historically accurate does not matter to me.  As Harmonium touched upon, truth and fact are not synonymous.  After the release of 'The Killing Fields,' director Roland Joffe asked one of the journalists, on whose experiences the film was based, if the film was accurate.  He replied with a yes and no.  No, he said, that's not exactly what really happened.  But yes, he said, that's exactly what it  felt  like.            ",

You may need the benefits of 'reflect'ology.  Ever heard of it?  'Reflect'ology is a practice that's been around for many moons.  Reflecting about or evaluating the past week is a natural process that can help relieve stress, identify weaknesses, and get you back on your feet.  Don't feel pressured -- just relax and consider these tips for evaluating your week:   Examination.   Create a checklist of five or six self-evaluation questions and keep them in your planning system.  Examples include  'What challenges did I face this week and how did I overcome them?' 'What goals did I not achieve and why?' 'What can I learn from the week as a whole?'   Regular checkup.   Make an appointment with yourself each week and choose a place that is quiet.  Review your questions before you plan the next week.  Prevention.   You'll soon identify ineffective habits and patterns.  This knowledge will help you prevent making the same mistakes in the future.

      "1": "           The Ten Commandments are the product of a 13th century BCE religion and culture, regardless of the message, and to place them on government property suggests that we should accept the deity Yahweh, or Jehovah, as our single, original source of law.  As for what is wrong with telling people not to kill, to respect their parents, etc.: nothing.  But what is curious is the need to enhance the already strong argument with the physical presence of the Ten Commandments, which, if one is to take them as merely wise suggestions rather than the direct prescriptives of Yahweh, have no more weight than what anyone else recommends anyway.  The only way that words gain weight, or importance, beyond their inherent meaning, is in either how they are used, or who uses them.  The Ten Commandments, traditionally, come directly from Yahweh through Moses.  Take away that connection, and they have no more weight than any other wisdom.  Are our society's laws so dodgy that we need to back them up with a direct line to the Creator of the universe?  My goodness, but that's an alarming prospect.         ",

And if so, for what reasons? Sean Landis posed this question in his Xanga, and I decided to answer it. I really don't know if I would.  On one hand: you do get to watch the progress of human history, which is very cool in itself. You can actually find out if you were right about what's going to send the world to hell. You get to indulge all the new technology, hell, probably see space farther than our generation will ever know (most likely, and Steven Hawking is a douche, all of you that believe him are pseudo-intellectual pussies, and I bet half of you don't know what the bloody fuck he's talking about in the first place. Don't spout off his rhetoric, give me some of your own fucking proof, assholes...just had to get that out), basically, you get to live the stuff we can only dream about now. That would be super-awesome.  But then the bad. Well, first of all, I would have to live with being a bipolar for the rest of eternity, which is always fucking awful in general. Of course, that doesn't apply to everyone, so yar. But secondly, I would leave behind all of my friends, family, those that I love. I don't think I could really handle it...I don't think the rest of you could, either, could you? If you say yes, you have no soul, what the hell are you doing on this BLog you homewrecker? And if you say no, haha, you codependent, totally non-self-reliant, tagalong. I AM JUST KIDDING! Really. I'm seriously codependent, so there. Like, really. Sometimes it hurts. I guess that's what codependency is all about. But whatever.  Hmm...so the answer in my case would have to be no. Fuck living forever, that would suck. And if I had to, I would just go ahead and rope myself, since that  would  work, per this example. Egh.  HEY ROSIE! My therapist said something the other day that was quite interesting. She said: 'If they're (the Phil triad, in this case) still fighting after this long a time, they're just doing it because they like it.' Would you consider this to be valid? I would, actually.

Actually, Linds is the only one that actually reads all of this, so Linds: I'm having your children. Man, what a braintrip to read in the middle of a post. Well, the end of a post. Man, I'm getting sick of typing. But I thought I would just type this much because, eh: I can. Anyway Linds, anytime you're ready, you can just infuse me with your children. It'll suck and all for a while, I don't know if guys are equipped to circumvent morning sickness very well, or labor pains. Hell, we can't even do breathing exercises very great. I think that's normally why our jobs are so limited. By the way, I'm sorry I got so close to your car last night when we pulled in. Yeah, I know it wasn't a big deal, and here I am guilting about it. I seriously need some help.  Speaking of, I'm fucking done.   the end     "

Identifying roles and assigning specific weekly goals to each one will help you balance. A role is a key responsibility or relationship in your life. Here's what to do:  List at least two of your most important personal or professional roles, (i.e. parent, manager, volunteer). Ask yourself 'What is the one most important thing I can do in each role this week that will help me balance?' These goals or rocks form a solid foundation on which you build your weekly activities. Example: 'Designer--Read 30 minutes from trade magazine.' Make specific appointments for each goal in your planning device. As things come up during the week, prioritize and schedule around your goals. Your week will rock!      ",

And are we going to dress up, Josh/Liz/Abby?     The Elizabethan language is flirtatious, joyous, filled with risqu double entendre and political gossip. Elizabethans loved their language and their words were well chosen. Have fun with it. When in doubt make up a word by adding ' 'st' to a conventional word such as 'fill'st my cup'.  'Hello', best said as 'Good Day!', 'Good morrow!', 'Well met' 'Good Bye' spoken as 'Fare thee well!', 'God save thee', 'I shall see thee anon'. 'Yes' be 'Aye'  'No' be 'Nay'  'You' are certainly 'Thou' 'You would' or 'You should' rolls best off the pecking tongue as 'Thou would'st' or 'Thou should'st'. 'Listen'takes power as 'Hark' or 'Hark now'  'Ignore that' best be whispered as 'Shun that'  'Come here' moves more feet as 'Come hither'  'A Salesperson' barks louder as a 'Hawker' 'Beer' slides down thy gullet easier as 'Ale' 'A Serving Woman' is a 'Wench' unless you've met a 'Maiden' who demonstrates a desire to serve.  'Until later' - 'Anon' 'Days'- 'Morrow' 'Evening'- 'E'em'  'Never'- 'Ne'r'  'Often'- 'Oft'  'Why'- 'Wherefore' 'Maybe'- 'Perchance'  'Away'- ''Aroint'  'Truly'- 'Verily'  'Thank you' - 'Grammercy'  EXAMPLES OF FAIRE BANTER   'He lies through his teeth!' translation 'He be a prattler indeed!' 'He killed himself' - 'He's stuffed a red stocking' 'It takes more than Sex to Make a marriage ' - There's more belongs to a marriage than four bare legs in a bed' 'They're having an affair' - 'They've mixed sugar and sand'. 'What an idiot!' - 'Thou dried meat's wag!' 'You perfect son of a donkey's tail' - ' Thou great and mighty clumperton'  THOU INSIDER TRICKS:  Hawkers revel in the good fun of barter with Competing craftsfolks. Get into the game. Should a Potter call out to you 'No fine pots in all the Faire. Witness their colors rivaled only by God's rainbow'. Respond with 'Fie thou sneap! Note thy crack in thou fine pot'. Address people by rank, title, occupation or physical description. 'My Lord', 'My Lady', 'Good Shire', 'Good Wife', 'Lad' or 'Lass', 'Lusty Bar Maid', 'Fearless Knight', 'Juggler', 'Silly Clown', 'old Sailor', etc. Unlike contemporary society. the Elizabethan's had a socially stratified society. They were constantly aware of their social standing and the social standing of those around them. From necessity, addressing people was nearly an art form. In order to feel comfortable at Faire, you will need to have an insight to their social level and yours (the character you deem to be for the day). Fortunately, Faire people wear clothing in accordance with their social standing. The addresses used are based on a combination of social standing and familiarity. Ergo, the Earl of `Rycrofft could call the 'Earl of Worth', 'Worth', 'My Lord cousin', etc. But a merchant or peasant would call both men 'Lord', or 'My Lord', or 'My Lord, Earl'.  'Sir' or 'Mistress' be always a safe wager for a personage that is not nobility, but so well dressed as to signify upper class.  To nobility 'my Lord' or 'my Lady' is safe if you don't know their name or exact title. The Queen is referred to as 'Your Highness', or 'Your Grace''. In the third person, the Queen may be called 'Her Highness. Dukes and Duchesses may also be addressed as 'Your Grace'.  Office holders such as Judges, Constables, or Bureaucrats, Knights and Squires may be called 'Your Honour'.   And there you go.  We've  got  to talk like this Monday.  Should be fun,fun!!!       "

They are  Letters to God    Current page    First post   and QuotesBlog    Current page    First post   Over the last year these blogs have been very useful to me, and I look forward to continuing to update them as the days go by.

I'll have to blog the story behind that some other time, but for now, let's just say that my life has been oh so different (much better) since then!  I fell in love with her and told her so for the first time on Memorial Day weekend 1993, and by October 1993, I was convinced that she was the one for me.

She became quite emotional when I began talking with her about heading back upstairs to her bed.  The bottom-line reason she was out of bed, despite her myriad excuses ('My belly hurts', 'I want to see my Mommy', 'I want to wait for my Daddy to come home') was that she just didn't want to go to bed.  She said she wanted to go to the doctor because her belly was hurting.  Then she said she wanted to go to the hospital.  When I asked her why, she said, 'Because they will help me feel better.'  'What will they do?' I asked.  'Give me some medicine,' she replied.  Well, she needed to put her hearing aids back in (she sleeps with them so that she can hear what goes on), but she needed some lubricant for the earmolds, which fit inside her ear.  We've been using Cornhusker's Lotion, which works like a charm.  I told her that the stuff I put on her hearing aids was like medicine.  Keisha also takes Ditrophan for bladder spasms.  I asked my mom if she knew whether Keisha had been given her evening dose.  She asked Jennie, who said no.  So, I told Keisha that we still needed to give her the 'potty medicine,' which would help her feel better.  But we agreed to do this only if she wouldn't cry or act upset.  When she said that she couldn't, I told her I didn't believe her, and I smiled.  This caused a small grin to appear on her face.  'See?' I said.  'You can be happy if you want to.'  Well, she didn't want to have anything to do with that, and she turned around gruffly and yelled something.  In matters of this sort, I did what every father should do:  I had her sit down with me so that we could pray.  I prayed first and then she prayed.  After this, we agreed to go to the kitchen to get her medicine in a civil manner.    I mentioned earlier that I've been going to bartending school .  Keisha has picked up on this from hearing me tell Jennie and my mom about the classes.  Since the Ditrophan tastes terrible, we always let Keisha drink something afterward to wash away the taste.  So, I told Keisha that I was basically giving her a 'shot' of her medicine, and we agreed that half a cup of cherry kool-aid would work well as a 'chaser.'  She liked that idea.  I even showed her how to do it.  Having finished with that, I reiterated to her that she'd been given this medicine, and it should help her to feel better.  She returned to her bed, I tucked her in, and did our 'good night' ritual, which is a tradition   my mom  used to do with me.  It goes like this:  Dan:   Good night.  Keisha:   Sleep tight.  Dan:   Don't let the bedbugs bite.  Keisha:   Right! I turned her music on, and I left.  Mission: accomplished.         ",

It is thus that I've resolved to make at least one short post a day on here, just to keep this mofo alive, and I'll probably say something extremely random as well, and I would encourage the remaining members (Scott, Will, Z (maybe?), as infrequently as you all frequent this wonderful establishment) to either make fun of me or add your own equally random rantings and whatnot.   And let it be said, that I am a lonely old man, struggling for attention using trite speech patterns (L337, anyone?), ridicule, and strange, borderline bizarre, analysises (trite speech pattern) of my surroundings and events that I predict  could  happen and be amazingly funny if this proverbial outcome were to be reached.   This is mostly because I miss my girlfriend, and I feel to vent my frustrations in a manner consistent with my innate retardedness: hence.   So...two things.  One: popcorn is really good. It would be better if I hadn't saved the wuss bag for last, the bag that decided to set itself on fire and burn everything within to a buttery crisp. But it's still good, even when accompanied with tasteless, horsepiss Caffeine Free, Diet Pepsi.  Second: there is a band called Drunks With Guns, and their name is painfully apt or so I've heard. I'm going to download some of their songs now and I'll give an analysis later.   Later, team! w00t!      "

    "query_text": "   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  ",

Referring to his Feb. 5, 2003 appearance before the U.N.s Security Council, when he argued that Iraq had or was close to developing WMD, including biological weapons, Powell told Russert the information he offered was not only wrong, but that in some cases the intelligence cited by the administration had been purposefully misleading.

Not that I remember. It was all 'Id'. I remember waking up crying and calling the blood pressure machine a 'stupid, stupid bitch', to which my mom, who was right next to me, smiled and agreed. Apparently I had been cursing everything quite profusely before the drugs wore enough that I was able to take control of myself again. I even looked up to the doctor and called her something to the effect of a 'stupid fucking whore'. She laughed. Doctors.  And right now, I'm feeling really out of it. I laugh at the most random shit. I can't think worth shit. The only things I can think are 'eat eat eat', 'pain pain pain' or 'nothingnothingnothing'. Well, I might be thinkin a little more than that, because I made this post.  The sad this is: they gave me an amnesic, to help me forget the proceedure, and while I did, for the most part, these things have an effect on my dad's side of the family of wiping our memory for the entire day. I feel like if I apply myself I might be able to remember what the hell went on today.

More reason why we should reduce the size of government:   Everyone who has ever bought a house can enjoy this.. (or dealt with bureaucrats)  A New Orleans lawyer sought an FHA (Federal Housing Admin) loan for a client.  He was told the loan would be granted if he could prove satisfactory title to a parcel of property being offered as collateral. The title to the property dated back to 1803, which took the lawyer three months to track down.  After sending the information to the FHA, he received the following  reply (actual letter): 'Upon review of your letter adjoining your client's loan application, we note that the request is supported by an Abstract of Title. While we compliment the able manner in which you have prepared and presented the application, we must point out that you have only cleared title to the proposed collateral property back to 1803.  Before final approval can be accorded, it will be necessary to clear the title back to its origin.' Annoyed, the lawyer responded as follows (actual letter): 'Your letter regarding title in Case No. 189156 has been received.  I note that you wish to have title extended further than the 194 years covered by the present application.  I was unaware that any educated person in this country, particularly those working in the property area, would not know that Louisiana was purchased by the U.S. from France in 1803, the year of origin identified in our application.    For the edification of uninformed FHA bureaucrats, the title to the land prior to U.S. ownership was obtained from France, which had acquired it by Right of Conquest from Spain.  The land came into the possession of Spain by Right of Discovery made in the year 1492 by a sea captain named Christopher Columbus, who had been granted the privilege of seeking a new route to India by the Spanish monarch, Isabella.  The good queen, Isabella, being pious woman and almost as careful about titles as the FHA, took the precaution of securing the blessing of the Pope before she sold her jewels to finance Columbus' expedition.  Now the Pope, as I'm sure you may know, is [considered by many at the time to be] the emissary of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and God, it is commonly accepted, created this world.  Therefore, I believe it is safe to presume that God also made that part of the world called Louisiana.  God, therefore, would be the owner of origin and His origins date back, to before the beginning of time, the world as we know it AND the FHA.  I hope the hell you find God's original claim to be satisfactory.  Now, may we have our damn loan?' The loan was approved.         ",

Hell, there isn't any noticeable emotion behind words, unless you're using the strongest kind ('I fucking hate you and wish you were shot'). Is it any wonder that I hate getting online, and thus, never do? Altho that doesn't stop me from BLogging, which is the paradox of our time.  BLogs are like the little journals I intend to keep but never do. Plus, they talk back, or at least, this one does. Getting perspective on any situation is good, even if it is a bad perspective. If there's one thing a bad situation can teach you, it's what  not  to do next time.  Or it can teach you humanity and how things work. Or both, mostly that, actually.  Or it might not teach you anything. Or it might teach you the right thing, but you go about learning it wrong. That's what happens when you get to be, what most people call, 'screwed up'.   What's really amazing is, though the ultimate goal (for lack of a better word) of life is death, life teaches so much before we go. It's incredible that nature would allow itself to exist when it will certainly die. Including God in this factor, and it's not surprising. But from the godless atheist viewpoint, thinking that nature would weed out the weak, it's surprising that nature didn't weed itself out long ago.  Maybe it expects us to do it for it.

Here are five questions he'll definitely want to ask.  Editor's note: This will be the last daily installment of Joe Conason's Journal. Beginning next week, look for less frequent but more in-depth investigative reports and commentary -- on the Bush administration and other political topics -- from Conason, every week in Salon.  Feb. 5, 2004  |  Tim Russert, dream interviewer  NBC's Tim Russert cherishes a reputation as network television's bulldog interrogator of wayward politicians. His image is good cop/bad cop in the same guy. This coming Sunday, the president will reportedly appear on 'Meet the Press.' That decision may well reflect, as Nick Confessore suggested today, Karl Rove's confidence that Russert isn't really so goddamned tough, especially not on Republicans. If so, Rove would be in rare agreement with many of Russert's critics on the left.   Knowing Russert, I think he would hate to confirm such nasty suspicions when he interviews George W. Bush (although he would also hasten to plead that some partisans on both sides are never satisfied, etc.). Let's help him with a few questions (and follow-ups) that nobody could call softballs:      1. Given the controversy about your attendance record during your National Guard service, Mr. President, perhaps the best way to resolve matters would be to authorize the release of all of your military records, including pay stubs, Social Security records and so-called retirement-points records. Will you do that? If not, why not, and how can the American people believe that you actually fulfilled your service obligations as everyone else in the Guard was required to do?   2. Mr. President, on page 54 of your autobiography, 'A Charge to Keep,' you wrote: 'I continued flying with my unit for the next several years.' But the truth is that you quit flying after less than two years, despite fighter training that cost the taxpayers almost a million dollars. Did your superiors approve your decision to quit flying, or did you just quit on your own? Weren't you suspended from flying in August 1972 after you failed to take a required physical exam? Why didn't you take that physical?     3. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the now-famous 'mission accomplished' speech you gave on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln outside San Diego last May. You landed on the carrier in a flight suit -- a piece of videotape shown around the world. [Roll tape.] A lot of your critics were appalled by that image. Here's a man who never fought in a war, never saw the danger and horrors of real combat, dressing up like a soldier and proclaiming a victory that, as it turned out, we were far from accomplishing. As you look back on it, has it ever occurred to you, that Eisenhower, who won D-day, never dressed in uniform when he was president; John F. Kennedy, who was a genuine war hero, never dressed in uniform either. Was there something disrespectful to the military in a costume stunt like that? Your thoughts, sir.   4. You have blamed the rapidly rising, unsustainable federal deficits on 'out-of-control' domestic spending. But Mr. President, the plain fact, according to every nonpartisan analyst, is that your tax cuts are responsible for a far greater percentage of present and future deficits than spending. Your current budget proposal cuts billions in programs for children and veterans. Wouldn't it be more compassionate -- and more responsible -- to rescind some of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans?   5. Sir, with respect, most economists say that the tax cuts are responsible for no more than 20 percent of the recent economic growth, and that the recession could have been addressed with a short-term stimulus primarily aimed at middle- and working-class tax payers, rather than long-term tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. These long-term tax cuts for the wealthy are the major cause for these massive structural deficits that we now have and the complete inability to fund some of these programs for children, the elderly and veterans. How does that reflect responsible Republicanism or compassionate conservatism?   You may say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.             ",

I think your mom just gave the orders out of desperation so man, I hope you didn't follow through. But it's alright, because there's a good weekend or so to recover, and me and Will are planning on having mental health weeks come next, and man, we'd be happy if you joined us.

      "3": "           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         ",

Surprisingly enough, this isn't directed toward anyone.  In fact, this is just kind of a rant.  However, I do highly suggest that people read this.  It's kind of a continuation/elaboration on Josh's post.  2) The unit SUCKS.  If you go there without a reason to be in there, you'll come out with one.  I think it'd be really funny to see any one of yall try to get into that unit- CRISIS would laugh their asses off.  Trust me, yall are nowhere near depressed, I promise- and you really shouldn't want to be.  I wouldn't wish all this on my worst enemy.  It's pain like yall will never have to go through- it's not something to take lightly.  I laugh every time one of you goes 'I'm so depressed today,' as if you know the meaning of the word.  You really don't, and fortunately for you, you probably never will.  At least I hope you won't.    But seriously, yall- come on.  The unit is no picnic- you've never been any place like it and never want to be.  This isn't some stunt for attention or whatever, and should never be used as one.  This is real- I don't think some of you get that- this is REAL.  These are our LIVES we are talking about here.  This isn't something that is going to go away. We can't just snaap our fingers and make it better- the hospital does not by any means, fix things.  We didn't just wake up one morning and say, 'hey, I think I'll be depressed and go to the hospital to get it fixed.'  It just doesn't work like that.  This isn't some broken bone that the doctors can just magically heal.  This is something that we might actually not get over.  I hope to God that we will because I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.  Point is, there is no guarantee that everything is going to be all hunky dory.  This is something that takes work- it's harder than anything I've ever had to do in my entire life.  We didn't come out of the hospital with all of our problems fixed, as some of you seem to think.  We're not 'back to normal.'  This is one of those things that changes your life, for better or for worse, but it has happened and we have to deal with that.  I'm not saying yall don't have problems- you do- but their not things that make you 'depressed'.  Just because you are sad or disappointed for a couple of days does not make you depressed.  Depression is something we will never be able to explain to you because you haven't been there.    I'm sorry if that makes you feel left out or on the outside or whatever.  We're the ones on the outside here, and I promise you don't want to and probably can't join us.  We appreciate your friendship and support, but we can't make you a big part of this, even if we wanted to.  There are some things that truly are beyond comprehension.  I really think this is the problem here- all of a sudden, we're in a whole different world from yall, and it's impossible for yall to join us here, try as you might.  You can't make yourself depressed, and even if you could, I wouldn't suggest it.  Even if we were to miraculously get better right now, we still wouldn't be able to rejoin your world, if for no other reason than we have experienced the other world.  Really, I am sorry that we've left yall in this position, but it's not something we would have ever chosen for ourselves.  But it has been chosen for us.  Unfortunately, we can no longer lean on yall as much as we used to, by choice or not, so we're having to make up for it by leaning on each other.  Yall are still our best friends, but you just have to understand- you can't always be there.  And Josh, I loved the British spelling.  Nice touch.    "

The online library (  http://www.help4adhd.org/library.cfm ) is a project of the National Resource Center on AD/HD (NRC), a collaboration between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and CHADD, the nation's leading advocacy organization serving families and individuals affected by AD/HD.   'Now more than ever, people need help sorting through the overwhelming amount of information available on AD/HD,' said CHADD National President Mary Durheim. 'The NRC's online library allows CHADD to make accurate, science-based information about AD/HD more accessible to parents, educators, clinicians, government officials and individuals who often are left without a reliable source of information about the condition.'  Users can browse or search the library with ease using a variety of search methods. The online library includes books for parents and teachers, resources for adults with AD/HD, and reference books and scientific articles for health and education professionals and researchers. Summaries of all resources are provided, and full text articles are available on the most relevant topics in the diagnosis of AD/HD, treatment options, school challenges and guidelines, and parenting tips. The library also offers full-text articles from 'Attention Research Update,' a well-respected electronic newsletter written by David Rabiner, Ph.D., a Senior Research Scholar in the Center for Child and Family Policy at Duke University. (Information about 'Attention Research Update' is available at   http://www.helpforadd.com .)  'We are pleased to be working with the National Resource Center on AD/HD and CHADD to help bring information on AD/HD to all those who need it,' said Edward Brann, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Division of Human Development and Disability at the CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, which directly funds the NRC and other prominent disability resource centers. 'We look forward to working with the NRC to help grow this valuable resource in coming years.'  The new online library is part of the NRC's mission to improve the health and quality of life of individuals with AD/HD and their families by expanding their knowledge and understanding of issues related to AD/HD and raising public awareness about AD/HD through outreach and the dissemination of information.   BACKGROUND   The National Resource Center on AD/HD is a proactive response to the CDC's 1999 Public Health Perspective Conference, which called for the development of:  a resource for both professionals and the public regarding what is known about the epidemiology of AD/HD, and  an avenue for the dissemination of accurate and valid information and materials related to the diagnosis of AD/HD and the availability of evidence-based interventions. According to the May 2002 CDC Vital and Health Statistics report, there are 1.623 million children with AD/HD (approximately 7 percent), ages 6-11.  In August 2002, CDC awarded CHADD $750,000 to establish and operate a national clearinghouse to disseminate science-based information on AD/HD. The Center is now fully staffed with healthcare experts, including specially trained information specialists, who respond to public inquiries in English and Spanish via the National Resource  Center (NRC) website,   http://www.help4adhd.org , and the toll-free number (800-233-4050).   Since its inception, CHADD has worked to improve the lives of people affected by AD/HD through collaborative leadership, advocacy, research, education and support: CHADD CARES. The NRC allows CHADD to maintain its role as a family support membership organization, while simultaneously creating new initiatives and free information clearinghouse services that benefit families, providers, policy-makers, educators, researchers and the general public.  For additional information about AD/HD or CHADD, please contact the National Resource Center at 800-233-4050, or visit the CHADD website at   www.chadd.org .  News From CHADD is a free electronic newsletter providing the latest federal action alerts, legislative and policy updates, and CHADD press releases.  Contributions to support CHADD are welcomed and can be made online    http://www.chadd.org   or via mail.

Alls we need is five songs, and if you read the latest BLog we've now got it. Ok sorry guys, this is boring, but I'm just stoked about everything so much I'm gonna pop. It's going to be an awesome weekend, der perfekte cap-off for a pretty lousy week.  Goodbye fair BLog and all the happy citizens who dwell within.      "

      "1": "           Justice Scalia's (who may be chief justice soon) opinion on the same case: June 27, 2003  |  Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly engages in homosexual conduct.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is 'an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.' It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as 'discrimination' which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously 'mainstream'; that in most States what the Court calls 'discrimination' against those who engage in homosexual acts is perfectly legal; that proposals to ban such 'discrimination' under Title VII have repeatedly been rejected by Congress; that in some cases such 'discrimination' is mandated by federal statute (see 10 U.S.C. 654(b)(1) mandating discharge from the armed forces of any service member who engages in or intends to engage in homosexual acts); and that in some cases such 'discrimination' is a constitutional right.      Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts -- or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them -- than I would forbid it to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true that 'later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress'; and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows best.   One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The Court today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada (in a decision that the Canadian Government has chosen not to appeal). At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the Court says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' Do not believe it. More illuminating than this bald, unreasoned disclaimer is the progression of thought displayed by an earlier passage in the Court's opinion, which notes the constitutional protections afforded to 'personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education,' and then declares that '[p]ersons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.' (emphasis added). Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned. If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is 'no legitimate state interest' for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), '[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring'; what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising '[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?' Surely not the encouragement of procreation, since the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry. This case 'does not involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Many will hope that, as the Court comfortingly assures us, this is so.   The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither infringes a 'fundamental right' (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws.

Stories...there are too many to start or end with: I saw a billion billion things there, and I could never tell them all. I can tell you I was stung by a sea wasp on the side and around most of my left ankle with a jellyfish tentacle, I was burnt on more than fifty percent of my body over the course of the seven days on that stinging sand under that eventually blazing sun. The blue flag flew the whole time, and the water was amazingly cold, but stepping within was a wonderful sensation nonetheless. I walked  everywhere , five hours straight the first day...and that was where I suffered the first burn.   On one morning the flag was red, and I, alone, stood at the shoreline and watched the waves roll in and collide; it was nothing short of majestic, they smashed together underneath that threatening gray sky, the waves rolled  from  the shore and hit the oncoming waves, and the resulting pillar was feet high. They crashed and rolled again and again, and there I stood for an hour watching them and listening, stricken with awe but giving no more indication than a wide-eyed stare, and later that evening, I did the same with the sun quickly dying, and as the tide reached its highest the ferocity kicked itself up a definite notch, the waters became monsters, the leviathans roared and pulsed their malevolence upon the shores, and, in all reality, took out a dune a few blocks of beach away from our own.   There are a thousand things I could say now, but truly, it was just a trip to the beach. I can put an upside-down spin on this whole situation but it was eight hours in a car, a few days at a beach, and eight days back. The end result though: it was something else, at that beach.  Surreality permeates my brain, and somehow it is blissful.    ",

If the content doesn't connect, you won't like the film.  In that sense, it seems likely that you prefer either filmed essays or escapist tales.  There's nothing wrong with this; it's just seems to be how you relate to the arts.  That said, I suspect that Lost in Translation did not get you because the content wasn't engaging.  Because without the content, I feel there is plenty of evidence throughout that it is still a strong example of storytelling, character exploration, and filmcraft.  It seems to me that you approach the arts as a seeker -- a seeker of either ideas or entertainment -- rather than as an aesthete.  There is nothing invalid about approaching a work solely as a seeker; but the more personal the quest, the more limited the experience.  As for myself, the film connected profoundly with me, both personally and aesthetically.  I suspect that the film's content did not resonate with any aspect of your own personal search, and was promptly (and validly, for you) dismissed in all remaining categories.         ",

As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          ",

It's probably more accurate to say what I 'like' changes over time, while what I admire or value remains the same.  I will always admire and value the craft and artistry of Pink Floyd.  But I rarely listen to them anymore.  When I do, I find I'm only visiting old stomping grounds.  The appeal is only in appreciation of craft and nostalgia for a time or place.  I am grateful for what they gave me at that time, but I now go to other sources for meaning or sustenance.  That said, I experience my changes in preference as a slow continuum.

I'll come back to that.  This thing with Calhoun did not start this, it only confirmed it.   Today, I had a really bad day. It wasn't the saddening kind that makes me think suicide. Quite the contrary. This was a day that is going to change my life, it was so bad. I was not depressed. I realized that I was fucking horribly mad. More than mad, I was homocidal. I joke about it a lot, but mark me, MARK ME, I was thinking about taking a baseball bat over to that stupid whore's house and finishing the job her ex didn't. And mark me on that one, too. This is all going to come to a point, I promise, but there's going to be a ton of malice beforehand. I said do with it what you will, and I hope that you'll do just that.  Actually, I didn't get homocidal until about a hour ago. Beforehand I was complacent, I was stoic. I sat back and got pissed but I didn't blow up. I always do that. Like I told Abby earlier tonight, I was just 'on a low simmer'. But for some reason this one just wouldn't stay there. I blew up a couple of minutes ago. I started banging things, and Katie was laughing and so was I. I didn't think I was serious when I was saying, GOD I'M SO FUCKING MAD. But then I felt great. Why?  I felt great because I accept the reality of my situation. I've been repressing it. I don't know why. I came down to earth and said what the mother fuck I really felt about it, and I embraced the godawful truth of it. It's that I am so fucking sick of being complacent and respectful to these dickheads that are going to fuck around with me, like that stupid whore, and like Julian, and this other kid I just heard about, pulling some shit.  I figured something else out. I figured out how much complacency I have with the cycle of abuses. You know how people do? First, things are going ok, you think it's all alright and whatnot, and you trust the person. Then they start to slip and pull some shit. And then...then they just come out and abuse openly, and they don't care what the fuck you have to say about it. And THEN, and here's the good part, they try to make up for it, and mostly, THOSE FUCKING CUNTS GET THE FUCK AWAY WITH IT!!!! ALWAYS!!!! And why is that? Because we all remember how good it used to be, and we figure they'll change, so we give them another chance, and another and another, and we convince ourselves that they actually are good people and that their bad, abusive sides really aren't what they are.   I'VE GIVEN IN TO THEM!!! WE ALL HAVE!!! I ALWAYS give in to Calhoun! I ALWAYS give in to shit, because I'm in love with the ideal, rather than reality!! I fucking hate reality! I don't live here! And therein lies the problem.  I've given up trying to exist in this world. I let the complacent side get the better of me. And I know I have, and so I have some apologies to give out later. But I gave up, and I let this dumbass motherfucker take over, this thing that I'm not. This thing that doesn't think for himself, he thinks for everyone else. He doles out advice but he can't ever adhere to any. I just gave up a long time ago, but suddenly, I'm back. Thanks, Calhoun.  And so, I need you all to meet this person I gave up on because he was too perverted, too coarse, too vulgar. He was the thing I talked about in that song,  I'm Just A Bastard .  He's me.  I've tried so long to keep him back, and I don't know why. Maybe I thought that everyone couldn't accept him, but now I know...everyone just has to, or they just have to leave me be.   So now: I need to tell the ones that have to hear this how incredibly sorry I am that I've been the one pulling the shit and blinding you towards the real me. I'll detail all the circumstances and then you'll know...perhaps you have known. Whatever the case, I need to tell you, the real me does, the one that has occasional and guiltless bad thoughts, and thinks that some shit really is gay, and really wants to take some people out.  And I want you all to know right here and now: I am not blaming ANY of you for ANY of this. I don't want to hear an 'I'm sorry' over any of this, this is TOTALLY not any of your faults. This is something I have done to myself, entirely. It could be said that your actions influenced it...don't think that either. It's how I stupidly interpreted them. If there's one thing I can't stress enough, it's to keep being yourselves. I'm preaching it, yes, and right now I'm going to adhere to it.   Please, don't take any of this the wrong way. I've felt it growing like a tangible presence since...god knows when. But it's been there since I can remember, and I finally figured out what it was, and am in the process of dealing with it.  Linds was right when she said, 'the longer you wait the harder it will be', but I mean more than just with Calhoun. I've been waiting so damned long and not admitting to myself that I have a pretty fucking bad problem that it's turned into a nearly-impossible-to-resolve crisis. But I'm going to handle this. I hope I don't scare any of you away.  I just can't keep him in anymore. All I ask is that you allow me to let him come out.  So tomorrow...'fuck her feelings'. In case I get suspended or do something really stupid and not like me, you all will know why because...I'm telling you. If she's going to get righteous with me, then fuck-a-hootenanny, I'm going to get righteous and then fucking some. I won't get fucking pissed on again, ever. Mark that shit, too.  No more abuses. 'I wonder when all the abuses became commonplace.' It just boggles me how hard I was trying NOT to think about them.  I'm sorry for this post, and I'm sorry for what might follow. But I just can't do the way I'm doing, for fear of losing my fucking mind.   Please bear with me as I try to heal all this damage I've caused. I'm so sorry to all of you I've hurt by this, whether you've noticed or not, I don't know what I can do to make it better. Hell, I don't know how to forgive myself yet.  Please forgive me. I'm sorry.      "

Also, the term 'social contract' makes me uncomfortable.  I have signed no such contract.  Finally, for the record, while I appreciate your aesthetic choice to use only lower-case, it can have unfortunate results.  For example, I consider myself a republican -- lower-case -- not a Republican, upper-case.  As with democratic and Democratic, there are subtle, yet important differences between the two.  As for the text preceding that sentence, I hope the tide turns in favor of those with this condition.

You said to me the other day, 'C'mon, you can't seriously side with her?' or something to that effect? I just about blew my top when I heard that, Rosie.

Absolutely none, whatsoever!

She decided a few days ago to make it a reality by using a permanent marker to write each family member's name on each chair, so that everyone had their own chair.  Permanent marker.  Our almost-6 year old is still learning to spell, so we all had to figure out whose chair went with whom.  At least she spelled my name correctly.    Nana 's chair has 'Nononon' on it.  She may have spelled Jennie's correctly, except for the upside-down, backwards 'e' that is pretty common with kids her age.  And we know that her own is hers because it has her name on it.  I remember buying this furniture on a '90 days same as cash' program 7 years ago.  I guess we need to continue 'breaking it in.'  But with black permanent marker?  I'm not alone, of course.

      "2": "           op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

I just know that, from time to time, environmental conditions are such that everyone in our family gets sinus infections.  I've been fortunate so far this season.  My wife Jennie and my daughter Keisha, on the other hand, have not.  Tuesday morning Jennie and Keisha slept in.  Keisha stayed home from school because she had been up all night, complaining from a 'scratchy throat'.  Jennie was feeling poorly, too.  Since she was a kid, Jennie has been prone to getting bronchitis.  Keisha was feeling better throughout the day and wound up going to school on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, Jennie called our family doctor and scheduled an appointment.  A few minutes later, she asked me what time her appointment was -- she was so 'out of it' that she'd forgotten that she'd made the appointment.  I was getting ready to go to a job fair at the Dayton Job Center, so mom asked Jennie if she felt well enough to drive herself.  Jennie asked mom if she would drive her.  I returned home from the job fair at the same time mom and Jennie returned.  Yesterday we went to Meijer to fill another prescription, and I saw the store brand for some sinus/allergy/pain relief medicine.  I bought for myself, because I've been feeling some of the early symptoms.  After we got home, I took the medicine and a nap.  I initially planned for it to only last until Keisha came home from school.  I woke up later when Jennie called me for dinner.  It wound up being a long nap then.  Now it's Friday morning, and Jennie, while feeling a little better from alternating pain relievers, is still experiencing symptoms.  She's going to head back to bed while I take Keisha to speech therapy at Children's Medical Center today.  I may pop some more of those sinus/allergy pills before we leave.         ",

But, the more I think about, the more I question it.  Don't get me wrong, I still am in favor of it, but I'm not sure that we will see the benefits of the initial establishment of the NASA with all the new technology, which is what everyone in NASA seems to be touting as a reason to do this.  Computers are already improving at a rate that puts them ahead of the software designed to tax them.  We are constantly developing new and better materials (plastics, polymers, ceramics) and other electronics.  I don't see where the demands of this new mission are going to have much trickle down into daily society.  Sure, there will be localized job benefits to the areas that get work on certain aspects of the project, but unless we get our kids back where they should be in math and science, those jobs will go non-Americans.

      "3": "           I agree that it isn't ideology.  I was just tossing that out as a random statement.  As to the press conference, it is the press asking the questions, not either of the two leading candidates.  It is one of the roles of the press to reveal that those in power have feet of clay.  That said, it is also one of the roles of a police force to protect its citizens.  Some police officers reach beyond the originally-intended boundaries, pursuing that end proactively rather than reactively, through violence, profiling, or similiar strategies.  Such acts do not represent a flaw in the role; only in its interpretation and execution.  Likewise, the press occasionally (some would argue frequently) reaches beyond the originally-intended boundaries, in the interpretation and execution of its role.  In both cases, the flaw lies in an unrelated entity that has grafted itself onto, or even assimilated itself into, the original whole:  for the former, that foreign presence might be racism or ideology; for the latter, I would argue that the unwelcome intruder is advertising revenue, of which there is a finite amount, and which is determined by a publisher's ability to make the audience feel equally happy, sad, and superior.  This is not to say that the press is absolved of responsibility; I only add it as a probable explanation.  I don't think that in this situation the press is revealing a flaw in its calling, which I fully support.  Nor do I think that the press is revealing any particular ideological preference.  I think it smells a potentional story, and in its eagerness to get that story placed between lucrative advertising spots that require the largest possible audience, it displays not so much a mindless hunger, but rather an embarassing clumsiness in how it goes about its business.  Case in point:  It displays neither skill nor intelligence to grill someone at a press conference.  This isn't sharp and cunning journalism; it's grandstanding at best, simple rudeness at worst.  Take the potential lead and go snooping around the back doors.  Set out the honey and wait for the flies.  Watching the press conference live on cable yesterday, I was struck only by the mutual train wreck:  journalists behaving like a pack of dogs, and a poor government functionary who made a wrong choice a long time ago and now believes in the empty role he performs.  I still long for clever heroes and cunning villains who deserve respectful cheers and boos.  I am no longer interested in thugs and bullies, no matter what color hat they may wear.         ",

As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.         ",

So from 10 to 3 today I ran around with her at the museum.  It was a great experience, and both of us had a great time.

Now, I cannot guarantee that anything I type henceforth in this post will be grammatically correct or will even make any sense at all.  Get ready for some stream-of-consciousness:  It seems that those blogs centered around a particular theme get more traffic.  I am talking about those blogs that are about technology, cooking,   help with blogger's block , creative writing,   quotations ,   job hunting , and so on.  Someone who wants to read about technology has a better chance of finding something in a blog that is more techology-based, for example.  Yet I also find it useful to read blogs that tend to be of a more personal nature.  For example, I may never get to meet   Mike Zellers  in person (although I'd like to, someday), but I can discern a lot about him from reading his blog.  I recently created a weblog about the job hunting process, called 'Get That Job!'.  I have set it up so that other people can contribute content.  Actually, I am eager for others to sign up as regular contributors or occasional contributors. So let me know if you are interested!

'So, would you like to grab a coffee after your shift?' a nervous Leydner asked Ginny in both the real and imagined scenarios Monday. 'Oh, Brad, I can't wait four hours to see you. You should fuck me hard, right in this booth,' replied the Dream Ginny moments before Leydner achieved orgasm.   In the fantasy scenario, Ginny did not hide in the kitchen to avoid speaking to Leydner while he paid for his meal.          ",

Well, back in the day, it was just not as difficult to track the old job search.  A binder, a spreadsheet, even your Sent Mail folder would do.  When I embarked upon my most recent job search, just over a year ago, I realized that none of these methods were quite right. I kept bookmarking job descriptions on the big job boards, only to go back later to find they had been removed. In order to better track the specifics of the jobs I was applying to, I ended up developing a very simple web-based job tracking system where I could store all of the job related information in one place (including the resume and cover letter I sent it), and retrieve it on demand.  After using the application for several months, I turned it into a free public job portal so that anyone can use it.   With all of the job related web sites out there, I'm surprised that no one has done this until now.  The closest thing I've seen has been on private career center sites which provide some job search tools for their paid clientele.  Other than that, there are some sites that let you track the jobs you applied to through their interface, but none of them let you track all of your job inquiries, regardless of source.  If you've seen anything else like it out there, please let me know.  Also, if you'd like to share how you're tracking your current job search, please add a comment below.     ",

It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?         ",

He is about Bush (but not necessarily Iraq), and he is about health care (because he's a doctor).  But in terms of gun control, abortion, the environment, blah blah blah, he's really no more left that the other candidates, if not leaning a little more towards moderate in such areas.  And I think he's a fiscal conservative as well.  He just likes to talk Bush-smack to get people all fired up, even if some of their non-foreign policy political ideologies are not so deeply divided.  That's just what I gleaned from watching him the few times that I have...I just like him because of his health care reform.  Being that I'm a non-senior-citizen with a disability, there aren't a lot of options for people like me, and I like his ideas on how to fix that.  *shrugs*  Bush-smack sounds...dirty.  Sorry.

    "query_text": "              Drink Water (or Eight Things to Do with Coca Cola)   This item was sent to me by MJ over a year ago.  I cannot verify whether the information here is valid or not.   Interesting facts: Water vs. Coca Cola   * 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world pop.) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.  * Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.  * One glass of water shuts down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.  * Lack of water: the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.  * Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.  * A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.  * Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop ladder cancer.  Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?   COKE: No wonder it tastes soooo good:   1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.  2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two days.  3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and ... Let the 'real thing' sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.  4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.  5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals. Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.  7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.  8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.   FYI: -   1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.  2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials.  3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years.  Still Want To Drink Up?   Update, 27 March 2003:   I've been doing some research on   Snopes.com , and I found this out -- The claim that the acids in Coca-Cola not only make it a handy household cleaning product, but harmful to drink as well are   false  .  Check out the   Acid Slip  page over at Snopes.com.  You'll probably want to add   Snopes.com  to your favorites list, too.  Please accept my apology for spreading false information.         ",

The press' representation of the public hearing I presented at on Monday   Now, there is nothing untrue in the article.  But, it leaves the impression that there was only dissent.  There were 5 speakers - 1 (Mr. Wilmont) expressed environmental concerns, 1 (Mr. McHaffey) expressed concerns about property value and noise, the other 3 were speaking in favor of the project.  Mr. Wilmont's comments were well expressed and received (unlike some public hearings I have attended where people were ranting and raving), and his comments are acurately and fully presented in the article.  Mr. McHaffey was more concerned with the rezoning of his property from residential to industrial in the past couple of years.  He has consistently (for the last 6 years anyway) complained about helicopter noise.  The proposed development will neither add to nor subtract from the helipcopter operations.  Again, while nothing printed is untrue of what he said, the emphasis of his comments is misrepresented.  Given the title of the article, you would think that nothing positive was said on the hearing.  There were 3 people speaking in favor of the project, and 4 of the 5 Commissioner's (same as Supervisors in Virginia) had positive comments and expectations resulting from the proposed expansion.  The last Commissioner did not comment.  My point is this.  If the press can misrepresent something relatively simple with a negative tilt, how much do they get wrong on issues where people don't know the details?  Reporters are supposed to report the facts and leave the opinions for the editorial page.  Not presenting the whole truth, in my opinion, is the same as stating your own opinions in a news story.           ",

If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.

For us poor folk, the natural social obligation, and rung in the social ladder, is to go out, get a job, get money, and work our way into the world because that's what everyone else does, or did about a thousand years ago when they were sixteen. And if you really think about it, it's nice having a car, but at the same time it's a lot of junk too, like maintaining it, foremost, then, like, when mom wants some eggs or mayo, and she chrows (as in, 'throws') you inna the car and sends you packing to the store.   It's interesting how unsurprised the store people are when you come in really late and buy weird stuff, tho. That makes sense, I guess.  But that wasn't the point. Blah, I forgot what it was. Driving's lost its flair with me. My parents made me drive everywhere with my permit so as to put the fear of God into me, I can remember not driving TWICE with my mom, which is whose I drive 99 percent of the time.   But HEY, you might get the one-armed man. Abby and I have seen the one-armed man. I took my test with him, he was cool, albeit a bit silent. I think he hates two-armed people tho, and the fact that he has a very low paying job showing stupid people how they suck at driving, talking to him in languages he doesn't understand most of the time (and that's not bigotry, that's fact) probably contributes to his loathing of the human race.  I made up a really big story about the one-armed man and how he lost his arm and thus detests the race of man and plans revenge upon humanity, and it sounded really good, but: 1. I forgot it, and 2. He probably just wasn't paying attention and got it stuck in a grinder or something. Not so epic as being punished by the Mongols after he took his special time machine back to the dynasty wars to avenge his ancestors, or something to that effect.  It was cool.  I had caffeine today and it shows. I never really make lots of and/or elongated posts much anymore ('thank God!' breathed the world) since I quit burning out. What a loser I am.

It states: Live with the attitude that there is an abundance of resources and opportunities. I think that this is especially important to have with respect to the job search.  I find myself thinking that I have so much competition for a particular job.  If I win, then someone else loses.  This monthly focus is a challenge to see things differently.  Sure, the competition for jobs is heavy right now.  But why not think as though  your job  is out there, waiting for you to find it.  I've posted a number of great quotations about Abundance over at   QuotesBlog  for today, 2 July 2003.  I cannot link to all of them here, because they are all worthy of reading.  You will be encouraged as you think about what they mean.  I do feel compelled, however, to leave you with a small bite of what you'll find:  'Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.' --   Carl Sagan  'Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit.' --   Napoleon Hill  'Life is constantly providing us with new funds, new resources, even when we are reduced to immobility. In life's ledger there is no such thing as frozen assets.' --   Henry Miller  'There are no ordinary moments.' --   Dan Millman  'Let your hook always be cast.

Or is oil the only remaining prerequisite for us to provide this service?  Wouldn't it be funny if, upon invading Iraq, we had found no WMD, *and* the country had now run out of oil.

I have a slight hill to go down before I make the turn onto Main Street.  I saw that I had the green light, so I shifted to 15th gear (the highest) and started pedaling as fast as I could.  By the time I made the turn, I was probably going about 25-30 mph.  Work's parking lot is less than 1/4 mile, and I saw that I had a clear turn, so I kept on going at top speed.  As I turned into the parking lot, I had to turn the front wheel hard to compensate for how fast I was going.  I didn't have control of the bike, and before I knew it, I'd crashed into a flowerbed, landing on the ground.  Fortunately, I was wearing a bike helmet.  After a few seconds, I got up and walked the bike, which was noticeably different in its behavior, to the lamp post and locked it up.  I hurried inside, removed my helmet, and clocked in.  One of the managers noticed that the back of my shirt was dirty from the fall and had me change into a clean one.  In the restroom, as I removed my dirty shirt, I saw that I had a scrape on the bottom right side of my belly.  I also had scraped a little piece of skin from my left pinky finger.  Throughout the night I had a headache, and, by the time I came home my right hip was feeling sore, too.  As I left work, I saw that the bike chain had derailed.  I put it back on the gears and tested it out.  It turns out that the rear tire is seriously warped.  Also the seat is loose; I had to adjust it while I was riding home.  I mentioned the accident to Jennie when I got home.  She encouraged me to put some ice on and take some anti-inflammatory medicine.  She also said I should have told my bosses and had them send me to the ER.  I didn't think that was necessary at the time.  I'll probably need to get a new back tire.  Ugh.

I've done a lot of thinking about things, I think I have a start on what I want to say to Abby and my mom, I talked with my dad for a long time (5+ hours), we came to a lot of conclusions, tears, etc. It's a pretty cool thing walking in on two guys EMO tearing together. I drank Coke and sat against the security door, he sat on a chair across the kitchen and sipped some water. And man, all that from saying, 'Can we talk later?' Something gives me the feeling that because of that, things are going to start to get better. And that simple phrase made the balance of 3 years' misery diminish and start to die. Well, alright, and there was five hours of talking, but the catalyst wasn't a total breakdown or anything. I think I like this method a lot better.  Hey, what can I say? Even I'm starting to feel a little better. I hit rock bottom the other day, sure. It's not everyday you almost break up with someone you love and are trying to get back to somehow. Finally, I can sort of stop the obsessive thoughts, I can rationalize my cognizance somewhat...rational-emotive, what a charm. I'm really hoping that life, after taking a big turn towards a tree for a while there, is starting to turn back onto the highway and pressing the gas to get the hell out of this town. It's just that these pills make me damn sleepy. Sigh.  Well...I don't know what to say. Today was a pretty good day. I was able to sit in quiet places and not freak for a change, I thought things through and wasn't totally catastrophic in all the outcomes. I may just be learning to trust people. It seems like such a turnaround, but I have a lot more to go, I know. But the turnaround gives me some place to start, thus: hope. And who couldn't use a bit of that now and then? I really hope things do turn about. God, I have a lot of catching up to do.  I really wonder why I shut up and let things slip by. Actually, I wonder what gave me away. Hm. Yeah, it's all sort of centered around Abby right now, that's one of the biggest problems in my head right now, but I don't feel hopeless about it for a change, I feel like we can actually make some progress now that all, or most, of the bullshit is cleared out of the way. God, I came so close, we came so close. I really love that girl, I wouldn't just let her go that easy. Linds has said that girls get into relationships looking to change the guy a bit...I could use it. That was random, I forgot why I put it (it had a point). Hmm. I just don't have enough time. Things need to be 100% now!  Ah well, I'll just do psychology tests in the meantime. Those things make me feel thrilled.  And I'm still working on that omelet, Linds. I'm trying to find a good recipe and some time to make it, but man, the goal is going to be fulfilled. And next, to key an asshole's car. Not for any mundane reason. I'm looking for an asshole parked in a handicapped space without tags or a window dealy or whatnot. I've always wanted to do that, and now I'm going to. I don't know what the city codes say about emus, but hell with it. They're too dumb to cause any damage, the poor buggers.  Go see Army of Darkness, it's the funniest movie ever!     "

This usually happens when I close the bar.  Tonight was no exception.  Actually, tonight wasn't that bad, in terms of its hectic-ness.  We did a bunch of liquor sales, but they mostly consisted of highball-type drinks (e.g., gin and tonic, bourbon and coke, etc.) that were easy to make.  I had to shoo people out of the bar at about ten 'til 2 so that I could finish cleaning and closing down.  After I left, I stopped at the convenience store and bought a quart of double chocolate milk.  Then I drove to the Taco Bell and gave the drive-thru attendant a hard time. 'Have I reached the border?' I asked.  'You've reached Taco Bell,' he replied.  I noticed the sign said, 'Think outside the bun.'  So I said, 'I'm thinking outside the bun tonight.'  Then I placed my order, letting the attendant know I was just kidding.  'Don't spit in my food, okay?' I said.  'It's too late,' he replied jokingly. After getting my food, I continued the drive home.  I've noticed that my most creative moments happen during this time, but unfortunately, I'm not able to record them.  A lot of the ideas revolve around fictional crime scenes, ideas for potential stories, and the like.  So I came home, sat down at the computer, and played solitaire, minesweeper, and freecell.  Then I decided to connect to the 'net.         ",

Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.

My dad's a good guy, he can't do anything but justify my problems, which, I tell myself, is just teaching me that all the wrong directions I'm taking in my life are the right ones; but somehow I'm able to get his real message and things turn out better. It seems like his old girlfriend, the one that made me all screwed up last year, has started talking to him seriously, and he told me some vaguely suprising stuff. That he still cares for her in the way he did before, he says not much has changed since he talked to her last. At the same time, it's not a surprise, considering how involved they were, despite that relationship's brevity. At the same time, she's married, but I speculate she has the same feelings. It's causing my dad some undue distress; and that little segment only took two of the thirty minutes, which can tell you how much we can talk about in a short time.  Time for me to go.    "

      "1": "             Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this               ",

These stories are about regular people just like you and me who took control of their destiny to achieve a goal.

Show me the money!  Do you know where every cent is spent?  Money doesn't grow on trees, you know!  Spare no expense in getting your personal finances in order.  Here are a few tips:   Time is money.   In your planning device, schedule a daily or weekly appointment with yourself to balance the books.  This is a good time to identify spending patterns and make necessary corrections.  Budget constraints.   Set up a monthly budget and stick to it.  There are great computer programs like Quicken&copy; and Microsoft&copy; Money that'll do most of the work for you.  Remember to include savings and a personal budget for you and only you.  Adjust as you go.   Don't throw in the towel when your budget's in the red.  It's an indication that you may be living beyond your means in some areas, and adjustments should be made (or else it's time for a raise)! Controlling personal finances -- common cents.

My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more 'gritty' and 'violent.'  In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism.  In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration.  As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it.  As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate 'veracity' with 'truth,' as if they have anything at all to do with each other.  At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the 'real Jesus,' the 'real Muhammed,' the 'real Whoever' -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth.  Evidence yields nothing but data.  Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about.

To carry out the directive, the White House has begun removing information from government websites about sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace.

Here are excerpts of findings since 1998.  ANNA ERIKA 427 beds, New Brighton, Staten Island  Resident with dementia wore urine-stained clothes for three days. Another had lesions draining onto clothes that went unchanged for two days. Another hid in room for days without eating or bathing, and was not hospitalized. While inspection going on, workers completed long-overdue records. Many residents complained about getting wrong psychotropic medication. When pills were missing, workers borrowed from other residents' prescriptions. Resident hospitalized after receiving wrong pills. Worker flushed pills down toilet instead of distributing them.  BROOKLYN MANOR 216 beds, East New York, Brooklyn  Resident had old and new blood stains on face and body, and was filthy. Staff did not respond to emergency calls from rooms. One resident lost 54 pounds in a year; home did not determine why. Records were inaccurate, incomplete or nonexistent. Worker signed that she gave medication to all 200 or so residents at 9 p.m., when she was not on duty. Kitchen and many rooms infested with flies. Residents made to work as janitors and in kitchen, in place of employees. One resident in charge of home one evening.  GARDEN OF EDEN 202 beds, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn    Operator routinely threatened residents with eviction, verbally harassed them and demanded compliance with unlawful rules, creating abusive environment. Medication handling chaotic, with psychotropic pills given haphazardly and at wrong times. Resident vomited for two days, no one called doctor or family, or monitored her. Meals meager and unappetizing.   LEBEN 361 beds, Elmhurst, Queens    Rooms so decrepit that 60 residents evacuated. Security guards distributed pills. Incontinent resident wandered home with wet pants. No activities in home, numerous fire hazards. Many residents 'ill-groomed and malodorous.' Workers 'psychologically abusive' to residents. One resident burned in fight, another shot.   OCEAN HOUSE 125 beds, Far Rockaway, Queens    Rooms infested with cockroaches. Residents sleeping on soiled sheets. Kitchen floor rotted. Widespread hazardous conditions due to dilapidated home, ongoing renovations. Operator and son accused of embezzling millions of dollars from home and Medicaid. Serious deficiencies in medication handling and residents' hygiene.  PARKVIEW 134 beds, Olinville, the Bronx  Anorexic resident allowed to deteriorate so much that she weighed only 76 pounds and then died. Of 15 case management evaluations sampled, none completed. Numerous residents not receiving psychotropic medication. Workers did not know basic first aid. Resident refused to sleep in room because roommate harassed him and had history of violence.                  ",

Dan know that I forgive you for what ever the issue might have been!  Also know that I will be praying for restoration in your life and that of your family; your mental health, full-time work, family relationship, etc., In the Holy and Mighty Name of JESUS!

      "4": "       Well, here I sit again.  'Uh oh' you say, you go and grab a drink because you know this is going to be one of  those . You sit back and stare blankly at the screen, letting a bit of spit fall from your open jaws as you sort through this post and get the message: 'I wanna bitch'. It's the same one tenfold, but for some reason there's something new to get out of it every time.  I'm not intending for this one to be long. Which means it probably will be.  I want you all to know, especially Lindsey, that you all did  not  screw up my life. Let me see if I can retell this plainly.  Leigh Anne called back shortly after Rosie to ask for Brittany's phone number. After a while she handed the phone to Lily. Lily's mom picked up and told her to get off because she needed to use it, whereafter she didn't use it. But anyway, Lily put down the phone and forgot about it.  Meanwhile, I set up this BLog and posted that one at the bottom in Kenzie's, where, shortly after, I deleted it, for reasons that will become apparent in a few lines here.  I had a silent line for 93 minutes before Lily noticed the phone off the hook and picked it up, whereupon she said 'Hello?' and I said, 'Umm...hi,'...there was a round of laughs, then Leigh Anne was inspired to talk to me and say that she was upset with me and didn't hate me anymore. After a minute, she told me they were setting up a tent and that she was going to go and help them. She was trying to get away from them for a second by locking herself in a closet or something, and I didn't think it worked, because she eventually gave in and just said, 'I love you,' and hung up.  So that was ULTRA cool for me. I went and played darts with my sister's friend who was staying over, I won.  They called back shortly after. There were a few more Iluvu's in there, there was some sappiness, which Leigh Anne alleged would happen, and then she hung up at about 1:30, whereafter, Lily tells me, they went to sleep.  So the next day I guess Leigh Anne was still like that for a while. Things went bad at about 5 that evening. They got worse at 6:30. Then I went to my dad's house feeling generally pissed at my dying fortune.  And then that night she just asked me to forget about it again. That she wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone, that she needed a friend. There are some other things that were more personal when we were together that came up, but they eventually were also rescinded until there was nothing left but a big fuckin' gap of silence, whereafter I put down the phone and read your posts. I had said no arguing, I felt like there was some here, so I just decided to call the other people off. Plus Rosie's  ultimately  childish post of 'Joah...God I hate you.' As if I needed anymore of that stuff.   I posted it to see whom of you would stick by me no matter what. It really seems though, now that I look at it, that Rosie was reallllllllllyyyyy eager to give up on me...some friend :), well we've got things straightened out for the most part.  Then I woke up the next morning and felt stupid because I really enjoy the outside input at times, so I went back on it but it was a little too late for that. So today in fourth I answered Lily's post for the most part(there's more answers for her and Lindsey after this one, by the way), and I resent an invitation to join the BLog since Lindsey had backed out and was mad at me.  So that is the story. Last night things were pretty good for a while. But I really don't care. Actually, at one point, Leigh Anne had this horoscope thing on her cell and was telling me to think of a question and tell her...at one of them I just said, 'Can I just keep it in my head?' and she said ok, and the real question was, 'Will things ever work out with me and her?', and the VERY astonishing answer was a bunch of star alignment bullshit followed by the interpretation, 'Give it time and it will work in the near future,'. I was like, WHOA. She asked what the question was and I was too stunned to think for a second. Then I said something about if I was going out to eat or not that day.  She always thinks of something bad when I'm making her laugh, and she bring it up, after which it'll be a thorn in my side and I really can't be humorous anymore and she'll start talking about all these guys...I swear to god, this girl has no female friends, and the ones that could be considered so, she can't connect with them, or they're lesbians and they're after her.  So that's about it for now, that's the story so far.  Fucking story.     "

    "query_text": "              Winning is Important!!!   I know some who say that it's not important whether you win or lose, but it's how you play the game.  Well, we   got one of those last night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA , as, for the first time since 1961, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended with a tie: National League 7, American League 7.  As a fan, I don't agree with that above statement.  I feel cheated.  I am from Cincinnati, and the   Reds     had one player,   Adam Dunn , a former Dayton Dragon, on the National League team.  Given that in the last several All-Star Games, the AL won, that the NL was so close to winning hurts more.  Oh, I'll get over it.  In fact, in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal.  Yet I can't help feeling robbed.  Major League Baseball, since the strike of 1994, has not been that appealing.  Then we get a no-decision like we had last night.  Now there is talk of a strike this year.  Oh, great.  A glimmer of hope has been the arrival of minor league baseball in Dayton, Ohio.  Fifth Third Field, which seats over 8,000, is always packed, and the Dragons always provide an entertaining experience.    This feels like baseball the way it was when I grew up.  I remember the Big Red Machine of the 70's fondly.  My hero was George Foster.  When I played Little League, I had his number (3) and played his position (Left Field).  I nevertheless couldn't hit very well, and he was a slugger.  I guess we weren't meant to be alike in every way.  How will this season end up?  The Reds are in a pennant race for the NL Central division with the St. Louis Cardinals.  I'd love to see them win the division.  Whether we'll get a chance to see this depends on the outcome of the strike talks and how the teams fare.  I just hope someone wants to win.         ",

Rosie has backed off on her anti-Michael campaign, and if her reaction (to basically nothing) seems overworked, it's probably not you, it's probably something else.  so... if that covers it all, go back to you lives citizens  PS Rosie, if you really feel the need to get mad at someone, why don't you get mad at someone you communicate better with.

Though I suspected slippage might kick in somewhere in the second movie.  I still maintain that Tolkien wrote a mythology, a history, and a travelogue, with heroic elements -- *not* an adventure story.  Which is what Jackson appears to have decided to film.  Which begs the question:  is this a book, or a film?  Clearly a film -- and as such, while it is a similar animal, it is truly another species than a book, with its own rules and expectations.  To put people in the seats, you don't film a book -- you pull the film out of the book, even if you have to alter it  to do so.  One can film a book, and do it beautifully -- but you better resign yourself to the art circuit.  We'll be glad to see you, but we ain't gonna give you box office.         ",

Forgetting the topic of the exchange for a minute, I did hear a funny thing.  Bush was talking about the expiration of the 'let's get all the dirt we can on everyone and imprison people without due process' act.  He paused for some reason, probably dramatic effect.  At which point there was a smattering of applause from who I assume were Democrats.  Then he continued and said that the terrorist threat would not expire on the same deadline, which of course got a tremendous round of applause.  I saw a replay of that portion of the tape this morning.  He definitely enjoyed that little 'gotcha' moment.  And, like I said, ignoring the topic it surrounded for a moment, it was kind of funny.  Other than that, as much as I like politics, I can't stand the State of Union address.  It never really amounts to more than a chance for politicians to put on a public show of what they are for and against.  The party in power will say that it was a great speech.  The party out of power will say it failed to discuss the really important issues.  Instead, we watched a rerun of Early Edition on PAX.         ",

Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons 'programs' instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   ' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you.

The Cobb County schools' disclaimer, in the form of a sticker on the inside front cover of textbooks, could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper ruled in ordering the suit to go to trial.     'We're very excited about this,' said attorney Michael Manely, who represents the six Cobb County parents who sued the system in August 2002.   The lawsuit argues that the disclaimer restricts the teaching of evolution, promotes and requires the teaching of creationism and discriminates against particular religions.         The sticker reads: 'This textbook contains material on evolution. Evolution is a theory, not a fact, regarding the origin of living things. This material should be approached with an open mind, studied carefully and critically considered.'   The judge weighed the constitutionality of the issue by applying a three-pronged test handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. In order to get the lawsuit dismissed, the school board had to show that the disclaimer was adopted with a secular purpose; that its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and that it does not result in an excessive entanglement of government with religion.   In his order signed last Wednesday, Cooper said the school board satisfied him on the first issue.   But he noted that while the disclaimer has no biblical reference, it encourages students to consider alternatives other than evolution. The judge found that the disclaimer could have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.   'Indeed, most of the board members concurred that they wanted students to consider other alternatives,' Cooper wrote.   The theory of evolution, accepted by most scientists, says evidence shows current species of life evolved over time from earlier forms and that natural selection determines which species survive. Creationism credits the origin of species to God.   In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled creationism was a religious belief that could not be taught in public schools along with evolution.             ",

Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.

    "query_text": "           the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter - this makes me proud to be a richmonder  The Cat's Pajamas  Richmond SPCA Opens Its Deluxe Animal Shelter   By Don Oldenburg Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, November 26, 2002; Page C01    RICHMOND  When you walk into the Richmond SPCA's Robins-Starr Humane Center -- an animal shelter -- instead of hearing pained howls and barks, you get soothing strains of Mozart or New Age music. Instead of the stench of hapless animals, the air smells outdoor fresh. Instead of depressed dogs and cats killing time in cramped cages, these potential pets are bright-eyed and ready to go in their 'living rooms.'  With its stylish interior painted bold yellows, blue-violets and mauves, the new 'state-of-the-arf' shelter, which opened last month, looks more like a fancy hotel. Natural light pours down from huge skylights. Bronze sculptures and paintings lend the feel of an art gallery. And the canine living rooms and cat cotillions are unmistakenly homelike.  'Oh, my gosh!' says first-time visitor Katherine Gregory, from South Riding in Loudoun County. In Richmond visiting her mother, Gregory stopped by the center with her sons, Andrew, 10, and Matthew, 7, in search of a kitten. 'I'm amazed. I recently went to the Loudoun shelter and the Fairfax shelter, and they aren't anything like this!'  Pound for pound, this 64,000-square-foot center -- currently housing about two-thirds of its capacity, which is 150 dogs and 150 cats -- is not like any animal shelter you've ever seen. The facility, located in a warehouse district off the Boulevard exit from Interstate 95, is among the largest nationwide. But size isn't everything: The center was designed to defy preconceptions, the theory being that a cheery environment will foster a higher rate of adoption.  That's critical, since the motive for this $7.2 million shelter was the Richmond SPCA's decision to 'go no-kill.' The group is also committed to making the whole city no-kill by 2008.  'What keeps people from walking in the door of a shelter? It's noisy, it's depressing, it's scary, it's smelly,' says Denise Deisler, the Richmond SPCA's associate executive director. 'This place is bright and friendly.'  The building is a 78-year-old red-brick tobacco warehouse with a verdigris seamed roof. Beyond the lobby are 11 glass-doored 'dog living rooms.' About the size of a small bedroom, each is furnished with a stylish blue metal bench and chairs and a puffy dog bed. A large Labrador-mix named Old Bay sits eagerly at the door of one. On his windowsill is this personal publicity: a can of Old Bay Seasoning and a note, 'I like lots of love and need to take long walks on the beach.'   'They will allow you to go in these rooms and actually sit with the dog, and play with the dog, get to know the dog, walk the dog outside,' says Tony Zimmer, the contractor who oversaw the renovation but kept returning after it was done.  A 'lifelong dog person,' Zimmer says he kept coming back because the people, the place and the pets left him feeling good. 'It's not like looking at dogs in cages. You actually get to know the dog.' A couple weeks ago, he took home a 4-month-old red chow.  The public can also visit dogs in the less flashy kennel rooms. The 22 'kennel runs,' each four feet wide and 14 feet long, are significantly larger than standard shelter cages.  At the opposite end of the shelter are the individual cat 'condos' and three cat 'cotillions' -- large rooms with open drawers, cubbyholes and climbing poles, where as many as 10 cats live and people can visit.  All details are designed to bring out the best in the animals. The floors are soft, waterproof epoxy-finished surfaces and the ceilings are sound-absorbent. The cacophony typical of kennels not only is unpleasant for people but also hurts the animals (dogs can hear frequencies more than 20 kHz higher than humans; cats, more than 45 kHz higher).  'When a dog is in pain from the sound, that elevates the stress level,' says Emerson Hughes, owner of Holiday Barn Pet Resorts and former chairman of the Richmond SPCA board, who oversaw the project.  Although the creature comforts are as much for visitors, Deisler says Mozart really does soothe the savage beast -- or confused puppy. In a study conducted at Queen's University in Belfast, psychologists found that heavy-metal music increased anxiety in dogs and caused barking, while classical music alleviated stress and quieted barking.  The shelter's classical music is digitally altered to put a damper on the ultrahigh and low frequencies. 'If they are too stressed out, that reduces their immune system and that leads to them being sick, and if they are sick we can't adopt them,' says Deisler.  But what an adoring public sees and hears in the adoption area is just a small part of the center. Only about a quarter of the animals are available for adoption at any one time. The rest are being rehabbed.  Behind the scenes, every animal gets a physical and behavioral checkup. Dogs with contagious diseases -- like Raspie, a 4-year-old Sheltie with kennel cough -- are confined to the Physical Rehab Room for treatment. Staff experts work with personality problems in the Behavioral Rehab Room. Even healthy animals get a three-day adjustment period to acclimate to shelter life.  Zephia Scarborough adopted a black-and-white kitten she named Steinway a few weeks ago. Because he had been trapped inside a wall for several days before being rescued, the kitten was traumatized. Before taking Steinway home, she had to wait for him to come out of rehab. 'Ten days later, he was fat and happy and purring,' the Richmond resident says.  Also hidden are the shelter's command centers for its centrally controlled, high-pressure hydro-cleaning system that borrows from car wash technology, and its advanced air-exchange system that sends fresh air throughout the building every six minutes. 'It's good for reducing the spread of disease and the odors in the building, and it has the side benefit of not collecting as much dust and hairballs,' says Deisler.  Near the entrance is the spay-neuter clinic. Each year, 18,000 'companion animals' end up here or in one of the city or county shelters in the greater Richmond area; in the past, half of those animals were euthanized. Now the center spays or neuters every animal when it arrives and offers those services at low cost to the public.  Pet overpopulation is a nationwide problem, of course. Accurate numbers aren't available, but the Humane Society of the United States estimates that 8 million to 10 million dogs and cats enter U.S. shelters each year and that half are euthanized. Locally, the Montgomery County Humane Society shelter, the only one in the county, took in 6,650 dogs and cats in the year that ended in July and euthanized about 2,600. The D.C. Animal Shelter took in 9,284 and euthanized 65 percent of them.  Deisler mentions a statistic. How many dogs and cats would every person in the United States have to own to empty all of the shelters? 'It just blew my mind,' she says. 'Six cats and two dogs.'  On the second floor is a 'humane library,' a large auditorium that seats 300 people for educational programs and benefit events, and a spectacular rubber-padded jogging track and training arena where all dogs are exercised and obedience classes are held.  'Part of making this community no-kill is you've got to provide good educational programs for people to understand how to do it,' says Robin Robertson Starr, executive director of the facility, who expects the center to help 6,000 to 8,000 animals get adopted annually -- twice as many as the old shelter.  At the forefront of a revolution in the pet care industry, the Richmond center is attracting international attention. Since opening, it has received 250 job and volunteer applications. (Besides 150 volunteers, it employs 50 kennel workers and staffers whose annual salaries range from $20,000 to $36,000.) People from other SPCAs nationwide call for tours. Starr has participated in an 'international chat' online and a conference in Atlanta. The Mayor's Alliance for Animals in New York has contacted the Richmond SPCA about how it is working with the city to solve the animal overpopulation problem.  The center's no-kill policy means it does not kill animals due to overpopulation. It takes in only animals that it can physically and behaviorally rehabilitate to an adoptable condition. All animals at the shelter stay there until they are adopted. 'We control admissions so as never to exceed our capacity,' says Starr.  Even private kennels are upgrading facilities in what the American Pet Products and Manufacturing Association calls a $31 billion industry: This month, Olde Towne Pet Resort opened in Springfield. Billing itself as 'The Ultimate Pet Care Facility,' it offers services such as an indoor hydrotherapy pool and an indoor walking track and agility course.  'It's more than just the building, it's the no-kill policy. No-kill is the real trend toward significant change,' says Starr, after whom the center was named, along with patron E. Claiborne Robins Jr. In the first 10 months of this year, 1,200 fewer animals were euthanized by the Richmond SPCA than in the same period the year before.  Some of the interest is in how the Richmond SPCA raised $14.2 million in three years during an economic downturn. Half of that went to build and half to operate; the operating budget, derived from donations, is $2.5 million a year, twice that of the old shelter.  'You work really hard,' says Starr, an attorney who worked full time those three years raising donations -- nearly all of them coming from the Richmond community.  Outside her second-floor office, playing with her own 3-year-old shaggy mutt named Nibblet, one of the four dogs and two cats she has adopted, Starr says people 'care a lot about the humane cause, but people don't care a lot about continuing to throw their money at something that never changes.'  What worked in Richmond, she explains, 'was presenting them with a problem that can be licked, telling them how it can be licked.'  But whenever an animal shelter upgrades beyond concrete floors and clanky cages, Starr says, someone always questions treating animals so well when homeless people are sleeping on the streets.  'I have trouble with that comparison,' she says. 'If we wanted to say that human homelessness is the cause that matters the most, then that could also be said of the money that goes to art museums, or the money that goes to botanical gardens, or the performing arts.  'All of those are valuable things that improve the quality of our lives. So do pets. They enormously improve the quality of our lives.'           ",

      "4": "       I think Linds is abso-fuckin'-loutely correct, so fuck it. Man, don't  even  delete that post. Let me tell you why this is so good to be said: it's true. The truth fucking blows a lot of times (remember me yesterday, blank stare and opposition to your every words about my dad, true as they were?) and it's hard to swallow, but that's about it.  IF PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOING TO JUDGE YOU OVER WHAT YOU SEE AS THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION, THEN  FUCK THEM  . Sorry guys, you really have to understand:  Whereas some of you have come to an edge and taken a peek over, we have jumped our asses over, landed hard, now we're trying to get back the hell up over and rejoin what the rest of the world would call 'normal.' Chaos would be a great word right now. That's all the hell it is. It's a big fucking vortex of uncertainty and self-doubt, fear of the outside world and the inside, all that good shit you hear from Faulker and Eliot (if you interpret it right).  So basically, we have the right to be assholes and tell everyone to just blow us. Let's not all forget, and again, sorry to be an asshole, but I  am  a suicide kid, a very swingy bipolar, and I'm not all the hell fixed yet. It wouldn't take all that much to bring me back to the old nightmare called the unit. Life has been pretty docile so far...yar, I caught a lot of shit with Linds, but I coped, I didn't come out broken down again. I don't know if I'll be that lucky again, and, being blatantly honest, I NEVER WANT TO GO BACK, NEVER THE FUCK EVER. I would rather eat my own right arm than go back, so long as I got some oregano and a nice baste. Hell, not even that, so long as I didn't have to go back.  All I'm asking is that you please don't send us back, in effect: acknowledging the hard but entirely factual truth of Lindsey's post.  We don't know anything about this anymore, I'll really tell you that taking a very objective look at the whole situation, the thing has be cojoned with so much fucking melodrama it's since ceased to float. That is a problem. That is not my problem.  I'm glad to hear that you've come to some resolution, Rosie. If it were me, let's just say, I would tell Phil to shut the hell up, his incessant bitching about the way shit should be isn't making anything better. Sorry bud, but that's the fucking way it is. Yelling at someone, being pissed, these things don't help. People NEVER positively respond to anger! You know this on some level as well as I. You'd only respond to it bad if you were codependent, and even then, you'd still secretly hate it.  It really doesn't matter who hurt who, it's fucking over. The horse is fucking dead, stop kicking him. He really doesn't feel it, I promise. If Philip does go off and fuck with someone else, guess what? Fuck 'em. Do you know why? Because if he did, he would be a worthless asshole (and Philip, if you read this, and if you act upon this, you are a fucking worthless asshole, and you know it, otherwise, you're fine). So in that case, utilize my two favorite words and move on.    Fuck him    And that's all. I really can't help Becca, she doesn't want to be helped yet, and truly, I don't want to try with someone that doesn't want it. I can't help you because there's nothing you need, and nothing I can give you. I can't batten down your qualms, and it really doesn't matter what I say, you know. It's just your ability to grasp the tangible and the real has ceased to exist, therefore, nothing I say will reek of valid like it usually does. And really, I couldn't anyway, because that would require me to understand, and really, I'm too MOTHERFUCKING TIRED to understand much besides depressed people (Linds, my mom and dad, most of the rest of my family), which makes sense cuz I've been there, and manic people, which is no one but me, and even then, I rarely understand it, I just endulge it. It's the only buttfucking time I want to move to any great extent. FUCK BIPOLAR, TIS BRINGING THE GAY. It's going to make me fat, and I'm going to be pissed.  so really, that's it. i'm tired of pressing shift, so i just quit capitalizing. har har. if it really matters, i'll go back and fix it later. but really, just fuck it all man. i hope you find it in yourself to really not worry about this, i can tell that you don't, no matter how much you try. a lie never helped anybody, especially one to yourself. go look up the 'serenity prayer,' you may already know it, but it would be really helpful if you don't, and if you do, you would do well to remember it.  Linds, aye. Lordy, I wouldn't wish trileptol, and effectively bipolar, on anybody, especially you. It really brings one to be learnedly helpless. You get good, then you get bad, and it never fucking ends. You figure out that whatever you do, you're going to come back down, and it sucks. It also helps to be up so damn late like this :) It's time to start.  I love you all, but some of you are making me pretty fucking batty :) (all of my heartfelt on that last sentence)  And Linds, remind me to delete this too. I probably should. I read yours and just nodded in agreement. I more laughed because I'm really getting a kick out of this whole 'I'm going to eat your soul, mafucka!!' bitchy phase. It's about damn time! The more people you own, the better you feel, so let's have assholes for every meal. Yar, it's really late and I'm really tired. Peace.    "

      "1": "             Tori Amos Scarlet's Walk  (Epic)  Tori Amos is one of America's most polarizing artists, with each album predictably regarded as a love-it-or-hate-it proposition sure to thrill every fan and aggravate every hater. But she's made good and bad records just like anyone else: For proof, listen to her sublime From The Choirgirl Hotel and her horrid covers album Strange Little Girls back to back. Amos' well-documented idiosyncrasies tend to be reflected in teeth-gnashingly twee flights of fancy just as often as they produce bracing catharsis, making her catalog both rewarding and punishing when taken as a whole. Come to think of it, that just about sums up Scarlet's Walk, her epic follow-up to Strange Little Girls. A characteristically oblique concept album about finding the soul of America in its open roads, the disc marks a vast leap beyond its more gimmicky predecessor. From the pretty ballad 'Your Cloud' to the irresistibly poppy single 'A Sorta Fairytale,' Scarlet's Walk moves through some remarkable terrain. But amid all the elegantly sweeping, minor-key arrangements are the usual aggravating moments, most notably at the end of songs like 'Mrs. Jesus' (yeech) and 'Wednesday,' which each close with a breathless solo a cappella vocal for dramatic effect. The result tends to highlight lines that don't serve her well: Try not to groan when Amos stops the music on 'Wednesday' long enough to wheeze, 'Lost in a place called America.' But on Scarlet's Walk, her audacity is just as often admirable, and the album represents a considerable step up for fans and foes alike. Stephen Thompson  not from that album but one of my favorite tori songs She's Your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs you can suck anything but you know you wanna be me put on your makeup boy you're your favourite stranger and we all like to watch So shimmy once and do it again bring your sister if you can't handle it she says you control it then she says you don't control it then she says you're controlling the way she makes you crawl She's your Cocaine your Exodus laughing and she knows what you are so shimmy once and do it again Bring your sister Bring your sister if you can't handle it If you want me to Boy I could lie to you you don't need one of these to let me inside of you and is it true that devils end up like you do something safe for the picture frame and is it true that devils end up like you so tied up you don't know how she came She's your Cocaine She's got you shaving your legs she got you liking mine back got me takin it in getting mine back lasting mine evil I'm taking my easel and I'm writing good checks you sign Prince of Darkness try squire of dimness please don't help me with this               ",

      "4": "       O not much Z...the usual insanities. Getting pwned / etc.  And now for something wholly depressing. And that is, not having a mother.  Well yes, I do, biologically, in that she, in fact, did give birth to me and still has a pulse and respirates.   But the problem lies in Glen, her 'boyfriend', I suppose would be the term...akk not for my mother, heheh. But yes, that's the best term. So the dillio is, she's been going out with him every day for the last three or so weeks, not getting back til the small hours of the morning. The other day she had Glen pick her up and left me the car and her bank card, so as to get money so as to be nourished. Which I did, in having Wendy's, which was really good.  It started out nice enough, and then it just spiralled out of control, I guess.  It's not that I don't like Glen; I do. Not that I really know him, but I don't see anything bad about him immediately. He's got a lot of money, he doesn't call me 'sport' (I said I would de-spinalize him if he did, right off, along with 'tiger', 'ace' and other such diminuitives), and he was the dumped one in his last relationship, when his wife cheated on him and his evil empire of money (well, not 'evil', per se, but it sounded good) collapsed and he was left...not in the dregs of poverty, really. He had enough to start over and has. He's insightful enough, and moreover, he's not an asshole, and that's always a good thing.  So all that good junk, why am I so pissed?  It's not like I'm so dependant on my mother for everything, it's just the abscence therein that's causing me some pretty heavy grief, and it shows in the way I write stuff. This all came up when I was suffering PMS (Pre Monday Syndrome) yesterday, and sort of made me think of things the way they are for a change (my world is my own, a little euphoric bubble of unadulterated bliss most of the time), and I must say, I didn't like it.  One...my dad. And he's reading this but I don't really give a shit. It's mine so blah. He's been really sick lately, some kind of bug, he's having heavy debt problems, so much shit, and somehow I've never been able to muster much pity. It's been this way since Becca, I haven't been able to be kind with him for very long. My mom once said that 'once someone's broken your trust it never comes back'. I attributed this to why I was always angry with him until the day I discovered that I am the only one that can make my world better.   I never tried to, though, to make it better.  And yesterday I asked him to come listen to my CD in my room. He laid out across the bed while the first track was going, and I went downstairs to get some tea, then I came back up and stood in the doorway...he didn't hear me come in. He was looking at his hand and he kept flexing it and looking at it, for the duration of the song, mostly (5+ minutes, I guess). I came and sat down next to him after a while.  He then told me that he was 'so blessed to have such wonderful children who would help him through all of this'...and then he cried, silently but I noticed, I always do, but this time....I couldn't take it, I just couldn't stand the fact that he referred to me as so good when I feel like I harbour such hate and mistrust all the time. And then I looked into his eyes and I saw the lack of sleep around them...under his eyes was a heroin-wasted purple and gray, like he hadn't slept in years, and the eyes themselves, bloodshot with tears and long nights awake.  That picture stuck with me, and his words...his unshakable faith in me, acting like I'm such a great person while I feel like I don't even give a fuck half of the time...all of this has worn me down to the point that I made a great long emotional post (been a while eh?).  I fear so much that I cannot control. I fear his dying, I fear losing my mother, I fear the school as much as I'd like to say I fight it and win all of the time. Most of that fear came with watching Linds feeling blown in fourth today, hearing the schedules she keeps up. Been having such  wonderful  dreams lately...one about Abby that was funny, other than that, I've been dissected and forced to watch, raped (that was a weird one), I've had to bounce around a city because every time I jumped gravity would lose it's force...the problem was the landing, which actually hurt in the dream, and that gut-wrenching feeling you get while being thrown around on a roller coaster to boot. The endless homework...it isn't bad but for crying out loud, I'd like to have a life...not that I'm going to do it anyway, but lives=good.  So now that I've been a post-adolescent baby once again, I feel a lot better...thanks for putting up with this as it comes all.  Ciao friends.    "

I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.  Sometimes with good effects (Roman and Greek rule was pretty good) and sometimes with bad (medieval Europe).  If we wait until the social problems are solved, then I don't think we will ever do it.         ",

All right, then.  Here goes.  This is a little  personal , and maybe a little   gross   -- consider yourself  warned .  This event happens to be  my earliest memory .  I was three years old and I had received an operation to repair a hernia in my groin.  The problem arose when I had an allregic reaction to the catgut stitches that the surgeons used to knit me back up.  The area got infected and, before I could get the stitches out, they needed to get all the pus out.  I remember this scene vividly because when they pushed to squeeze the pus out, the pain was   excruciating  !  I remember screaming and crying because it hurt so bad.  I felt helpless.  After the experience was over, the hospital people gave me a Batman colorforms set for ' being so brave '.  In addition to  Batman , some of my other favorite TV shows were  Shazaam!  and  The Six Million Dollar Man .  Sometimes, Mom would safety pin a towel on my back, and I would race down the steps to our front door and cry out, '  Shazaam!  ', just like the main character did on the show.  Then I would go around looking for problems to fix, bad guys to beat up, and so on.  At other times, I would play with my Steve Austin, Six Million Dollar Man, action figure.  It even had a magnifying glass so that I could look through his right eye, just like the 'real' Steve Austin did on TV.  I remember after coming home from the hospital, we had a family reunion of some type at our house.  Well, I was just so proud, having come off the operating table, that I went around telling people that  I, too, had bionic parts inside me .  And I was just about to show someone by climbing up in one of the trees in front of our house, when Dad caught me.  From that moment throughout my childhood I was not allowed to climb any trees.  I thought Dad just didn't believe, but now I realize that he did want me to go back to the hospital so soon after coming home.  I cannot remember, but maybe a jump like that is what led to my operation in the first place.         ",

I also believe that it needs to extend beyond the job search and into one's live in general.  Even after obtaining a new job, I still recognize the value of keeping in touch with old business contacts.  You never know when something you know or have may be beneficial to someone else, and vice versa.  Still, effective networking is different today than it was some years ago.  The old techniques no longer work.  In his article '  Handy Hints for the Smart Job-Seeker ' for Businessweek Online, Michael Laskoff discusses these differences with some tips for effective networking.

Now that Dean has abandoned his no attacking policy, I wonder how long it will be before Edwards does as well.  I am also curious as to why Wes Clark is spending so much money on TV ads in Virginia at this early juncture.  While it is a very good introctory ad, I have seen it enough times now to have a couple of questions about its veracity.  I am not saying that he has lied or even stretched the truth, but I don't think he has put forth the whole truth.  I really doubt that he had much to do with the actually negotiating the peace in Serbia.  He probably had a roll, but we have diplomats to handle these things and soldiers to enforce them.  Also, he comments that this was done without the loss of American lives.  The biggest difference is that we went in to an area where they hate each other (Serbs/Croats) more than they hate us.  In Iraq, the insurgents hate us, not the Shiites/Sunnis.  Yet again, I still have not heard a proposed answer to the situation (other than Dean's saying we need to pull out totally, now).  If you want to lead, you need to have answers, not just point out the obvious problems.         ",

It was not what I had expected, yet it was wonderful all the same.  Convicting, powerful, encouraging, too.  Afterward, Keisha and I stopped at the Hardee's in Middletown for a quick bite to eat.
